      "abstract": "Endometrial carcinoma, the most common malignancy of the female genital tract, remains challenging to treat despite early-stage dominance. Surgical interventions and irradiation are insufficient for advanced endometrial cancer. Our aim was to investigate to explore the in vitro cytotoxicity and apoptotic effects of boric acid (BA) on endometrial adenocarcinoma cell lines (Ishikawa and HEC-1B cell lines), providing experimental evidence for the potential application of boric acid as an anticancer drug. Time- and dose-dependent cell viability was determined with the XTT cell proliferation test. Differences in mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR using cDNAs and SYBR green assay. Colony formation and the effect of BA on wound healing were evaluated. Immunocytochemistry and TUNEL tests were performed to evaluate apoptosis. BA increased the expression of Caspase 3 and Bax in HEC-1B and Ischikawa cell lines. It was determined that BA significantly decreased the number of colonies in both cell lines (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In HEC-1B and Ishikawa cell lines, there was an increase in cell migration in the control group at 16 and 24\u00a0h. The apoptotic index was higher in the BA group, although it was not statistically significant. According to immunohistochemistry results, Caspase 3 and Bax expression in HEC-1B and Ishikawa cell lines were statistically increased in BA group. The expression of Bcl-2 was decreased statistically with BA treatment in both cell lines (p\u2009=\u20090.0001). BA treatment inhibited cell migration and colony formation, which are important for carcinogenesis, in endometrial adenocarcinoma cell lines. This inhibition was shown to occur through the apoptotic pathway.",

      "abstract": "The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system for endometrial cancer (EC) integrates various clinicopathological factors associated with EC prognosis to aid in prognosis prediction and treatment guidance. Although the 2009 FIGO staging criteria excluded ascites/peritoneal flushing fluid cytology, the importance of this factor remains controversial. This review thoroughly analyzed the current problems in ascites/peritoneal flushing fluid cytology sample submission and investigates the association between positive ascites/peritoneal flushing fluid cytology (PAC/PPC) and EC prognosis across different patient groups, including various stages, histological types, risk stratifications, and molecular subtypes. The findings demonstrated that PPC significantly impacted patient prognosis. Therefore, based on current evidence, the author advocates for the continued submission of ascites/peritoneal flushing fluid cytology as a crucial and indispensable step in the surgical staging of EC. In clinical practice, emphasis should be placed on the accuracy, reliability, and submission rate of EC cytology testing. The necessity for more aggressive treatment approaches requires the validation through large-scale prospective studies.",

Based on the 2009 staging system, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) published updated staging system in 2023, incorporating factors such as tumor tissue type, histological grading, lymphovascular space invasion, low-volume lymph node metastasis and molecular profiling. However, the real world clinical application value of the new staging is still unclear. Therefore, this review focused on the updation details and discussed the clinical significance of FIGO 2023 staging system, comparing the difference and the clinical practice impact between the \"new\" and \"old\" staging systems. Through this review, it is expected that the accurate diagnosis and treatment of endometrial cancer could be improved, and practical guidance for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of endometrial cancer would be provided.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignant disease in Canada, and women with an elevated body mass index carry an increased lifetime risk of developing this disease. As rates of obesity have risen, the rates of endometrial cancer have seen a similar rise. Given this association, women diagnosed with endometrial cancer often suffer from several obesity-related co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Studies have suggested that women with early-stage endometrial cancer have a higher potential to die of obesity-related complications than recurrence and that weight reduction would be beneficial for these patients to improve quality-of-life and long-term obesity-related morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery is currently the only treatment modality to result in sustained long-term weight loss for this cohort of patients. Early evidence has suggested that combining bariatric surgery with total laparoscopic hysterectomy may improve the underlying metabolic disease, the patients' quality of life, and the long-term obesity-related morbidity and mortality. Additionally, the inclusion of bariatric surgery in treatment of patients with obesity and endometrial cancer may decrease the projected lifetime health care cost when compared to hysterectomy alone. This narrative review aims to examine the evidence surrounding endometrial cancer and its link to obesity. Further, we hope to explore current treatments for the aforementioned conditions and the possible benefits and feasibility of a combined intervention of vertical sleeve gastrectomy and total laparoscopic hysterectomy for patients with obesity and endometrial cancer.",

      "abstract": "Despite similarities in microsatellite instability (MSI) between colon and endometrial cancer, there are many clinically important organ-specific features. The molecular differences between these 2 MSI cancers are underexplored because the usual differentially expressed gene analysis yields too many noncancer-specific normally expressed genes. We aimed to identify cancer-specific genes in MSI colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) and MSI endometrial carcinoma (ECs) using a modified partial least squares discriminant analysis. We obtained a list of cancer-specific genes in MSI CRC and EC by taking the intersection of the genes obtained from tumor samples and normal samples. Specifically, we obtained publically available 1319 RNA sequencing data consisting of MSI CRCs, MSI ECs, normal colon including the rectum, and normal endometrium from The Cancer Genome Atlas and genome-tissue expression sites. To reduce gene-centric dimensions, we retained only 3924 genes from the original data by performing the usual differentially expressed gene screening for tumor samples using DESeq2. The usual partial least squares discriminant analysis was performed for tumor samples, producing 625 genes, whereas for normal samples, projection vectors with zero covariance were sampled, their weights were square-summed, and genes with sufficiently high values were selected. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment, protein-protein interaction, and survival analyses were performed for functional and clinical validation. We identified 30 cancer-specific normal-invariant genes, including Zic family members (ZIC1, ZIC4, and ZIC5), DPPA2, PRSS56, ELF5, and FGF18, most of which were cancer-associated genes. Although no statistically significant GO terms were identified in the GO term enrichment analysis, cell differentiation was observed as potentially significant. In the protein-protein interaction analysis, 17 of the 30 genes had at least one connection, and when first-degree neighbors were added to the network, many cancer-related pathways, including MAPK, Ras, and PI3K-Akt, were enriched. In the survival analysis, 16 genes showed statistically significant differences between the lower and higher expression groups (3 in CRCs and 15 ECs). We developed a novel approach for selecting cancer-specific normal-invariant genes from relevant gene expression data. Although we believe that tissue-specific reactivation of embryonic genes might explain the cancer-specific differences of MSI CRC and EC, further studies are needed for validation.",

      "abstract": "Cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, and ovarian cancer are the three most common gynecological malignancies. Their occurrence seriously affects women's health and life. Despite aggressive treatments, some patients still find it difficult to benefit from available therapies. Ribonucleic acid reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) is a limiting RNR enzyme involved in DNA synthesis and damage repair and plays a crucial role in many key cellular processes such as cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and senescence. Many studies have also shown that RRM2 also has a significant impact on tumor progression. However, the role of RRM2 in gynecological tumors has not been systematically studied. Our bioinformatics analysis of datasets related to cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers revealed that RRM2 is a significantly differentially expressed gene common to these cancers. We found that RRM2 was significantly overexpressed in cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancer tissues and cells, exhibiting overall pro-oncogenic effects. RRM2 promoted cell proliferation, migration invasion, angiogenesis, and cell cycle in gynecological tumors while inhibiting apoptosis. The potential oncogenic effects of RRM2 in gynecologic tumor cell lines were further demonstrated using the RRM2 inhibitor Triapine (3-AP). These pro-tumorigenic effects may then be mediated through the involvement of RRM2 in the p53 and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways, altering the expression of p53 and Akt/mTOR. Thus, RRM2 is potentially a candidate gene for the unified diagnosis of cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers.",

      "abstract": "Uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) is a prevalent malignancy within the female reproductive system, with a rising global incidence. Although thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein 13 (TRIP13) has been implicated in various tumor etiologies and progressions, its role in UCEC remains poorly characterized. This study aimed to delineate TRIP13's expression profile in UCEC by analyzing transcriptome data from multiple databases. We investigated genomic alterations and epigenetic modifications of the TRIP13 gene using the cBioPortal tool. The prognostic value of TRIP13 was assessed via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression modeling. Additionally, we examined TRIP13's impact on immunotherapy responsiveness and chemotherapy sensitivity through immunological and pharmacological analyses. The expression of TRIP13 in both normal endometrial and cancer cell lines was evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Our findings reveal that TRIP13 expression in UCEC tumor samples is significantly higher than in normal tissues and increases with tumor grade and stage progression. High TRIP13 expression is significantly associated with poor prognosis in UCEC patients, establishing it as an independent prognostic biomarker. TRIP13 shows a positive correlation with immunosuppressive cell infiltration and a negative correlation with immune-activating cell infiltration, suggesting a potential role in tumor immune evasion. Further analysis identified TRIP13 as a potential biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response. Moreover, TRIP13 expression is significantly associated with sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic agents, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target. qPCR experiments confirmed the overexpression of TRIP13 in endometrial cancer cell lines. The role of TRIP13 in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, as well as its predictive value for immunotherapy and chemotherapy responses, underscores its importance in developing personalized treatment strategies for UCEC. These findings provide novel molecular targets and therapeutic insights for a precision medicine approach to UCEC.",

      "abstract": "Lynch syndrome (LS), caused by inherited mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes including MSH2, carries a 60% lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer (EC). Beyond hypermutability, mechanisms driving LS-associated EC remain unclear. We investigated MSH2 loss in EC pathogenesis using a mouse model (PR-Cre Msh2LoxP/LoxP, abbreviated Msh2KO), primary cell lines, human tissues, and human EC cells with isogenic MSH2 knockdown. By eight months, 58% of Msh2KO mice developed endometrial atypical hyperplasia (AH), a precancerous lesion. At 12-16 months, 47% of Msh2KO mice exhibited either AH or ECs with histologic similarities to human LS-ECs. Transcriptomic profiling of EC from Msh2KO mice revealed mitochondrial dysfunction-related pathway alterations. Subsequent studies in vitro and in vivo revealed mitochondrial dysfunction based upon two mechanisms: mitochondrial content reduction and structural disruptions in retained mitochondria. Human LS-ECs also exhibited mitochondrial content reduction compared to non-LS-ECs. Functional studies demonstrated metabolic reprogramming of MSH2-deficient EC cells, including reduced oxidative phosphorylation and increased susceptibility to glycolysis suppression. These findings identified mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disruption as consequences of MSH2 deficiency in EC. Mitochondrial and metabolic aberrations should be evaluated as biomarkers for endometrial carcinogenesis or risk stratification and represent potential targets for cancer interception in women with LS.",

This case report highlights the integration of holography and augmented reality (AR) in a 34-year-old woman undergoing robotic-assisted surgery for endometrial cancer. Preoperative imaging combined with single-photon emission computed tomography and computed tomography identified sentinel lymph nodes, which were visualized using mixed reality (MR) technology. This approach enabled the surgical team to accurately understand the three-dimensional spatial relationships between lymph nodes and surrounding critical structures. Holographic projections provided precise guidance during surgery, improving lymph node identification and minimizing invasiveness. No lymph node metastasis was detected, but a diagnosis of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIIA was confirmed due to tumor seeding in the peritoneum. The patient underwent successful adjuvant chemotherapy with no recurrence observed. This report demonstrates the significant potential of holography and AR to enhance spatial awareness and surgical precision. These technologies represent a promising advancement in sentinel lymph node biopsy for patients with gynecologic cancers, contributing to reduced surgical invasiveness and alleviating stress for surgeons.",

Tumors with an immune-activated environment are highly responsive to ICIs. To identify the cells and molecules essential to the formation of an immune-activated cancer microenvironment, we focused on the tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) and performed histological and genomic analyses using endometrial cancer material. In the high immunogenic group, numerous TLSs were observed, and CXCL9 and CXCL13 expression was markedly increased. CXCL9-positive antigen-presenting and CXCL13-positive follicular dendritic cells were distributed in the T- and B-cell zones of TLSs, respectively. A group of molecules whose expression was upregulated along with CXCL9 and CXCL13 expression was strongly associated with cellular immunity. These results suggest that CXCL9-expressing antigen-presenting cells and CXCL13-expressing follicular dendritic cells coordinately shape the immune-activated microenvironment through TLS formation. The current findings will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the activated cancer immune microenvironment, thereby advancing the field of precision cancer medicine.",

      "abstract": "Surgery quality in gynecology oncology trials varies, potentially biasing results. This systematic review examines methods for assuring surgical quality in multi-center gynecologic oncology trials and the impact on patient outcomes. A systematic search (2000-2023) was conducted in Medline, Embase, and Web of Science. Multi-center randomized controlled trials reporting on surgical endometrial and cervical cancer trials and lymph node harvest, short-term mortality, or conversion rate were included. Studies were assessed using a 10-point checklist to determine surgical quality. This was used to assess the association with variation in lymph node harvest, post-operative mortality, and conversion rate. Overall, 5963 titles and abstracts were screened for their eligibility and 10 studies reporting on 22 surgical-only arms were included for further analysis. The total number of included patients was 7434 from 366 centers. Analysis showed that standardization of surgical approach (\u03b2 = -6.6, 95%, p = .043), standardization of the extent of lymphadenectomy (\u03b2 = -2.432, p = .004), video assessment pre-trial (\u03b2 = -3.492, p = .04) and monitoring of data including clinical outcome measures (\u03b2 = -4.018, p = .009) were significantly associated with reducing variation in lymph node harvest. It also showed that standardization of the extent of lymphadenectomy (\u03b2 = -0.718, p < .001) and pre-trial case/procedure volume assessment (\u03b2 = -0.531, p = .049) were significantly associated with reducing short-term mortality. The regression model showed standardization of the extent of lymphadenectomy (\u03b2 = -3.123, p = .034) was significantly associated with reducing conversion rate. In conclusion, the heterogeneity of surgical quality measures showed that there is no clear consensus on the approach to delivering surgical quality assurance in gynecology oncology trials. The analysis in this evidence synthesis has shown a potential association between different aspects of surgical quality assurance and clinical outcomes. Further research is required to develop a framework ensuring surgical quality deliverance in gynecology oncology trials.",

      "abstract": "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising non-invasive tool that has been demonstrated to be a clinically useful biomarker in several tumor types for risk stratification, prognosis, and early detection of recurrence. However, there are limited data on the clinical utility of ctDNA in endometrial cancer (EC) compared with other solid tumors. The evolution of EC management through the integration of molecular characterization into the treatment algorithm has intensified the need to develop more effective predictive biomarkers to optimize treatment and reduce clinical toxicities. Given its non-invasive nature and its ability to represent and complement tumor multiclonal spatial and temporal heterogeneity, ctDNA could act as a valid surrogate for tissue sampling. In addition to plasma ctDNA detection being associated with clinicopathologic features of tumor aggressiveness at pre-operative assessment, an association with reduced disease-free survival and overall survival has been observed in patients with detectable ctDNA. Moreover, the half-life of ctDNA is significantly shorter than CA125, and plasma levels are reported to be completely cleared from the blood within 1 week from surgical debulking. Therefore, ctDNA may serve as a dynamic biomarker for occult microscopic residual disease when assessed within the first 4 to 8 weeks after eradicative surgery. Few studies have reported high sensitivity of ctDNA in detecting disease recurrence at longitudinal follow-up, although there are limited data comparing ctDNA and traditional serum biomarkers (CA125 and HE4) in identifying recurrence. In the perspective of personalized oncology, ctDNA may potentially help improve adjuvant therapeutic management by escalating/de-escalating treatment based on ctDNA detection after surgery, during maintenance, or in the recurrent/metastatic setting, in addition to acting as a sensitive biomarker for early detection of recurrence. Several challenges hinder the use of ctDNA in EC, including the lack of standardized protocols, the low mutational burden, tumor heterogeneity, and background normal DNA, which limit assay sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the high cost of ctDNA analysis, particularly, next-generation sequencing, restricts its accessibility. Future trials should focus on cost-effective approaches to ensure sustainability and efficient resource allocation.",

      "abstract": "New molecular approaches are being developed to detect endometrial cancer using minimally invasive sampling methods. This study aims to evaluate the acceptability of self-collected cervicovaginal samples among women with Lynch syndrome, a group at high risk for developing endometrial cancer. Participants collected cervicovaginal self-samples and answered an at-home acceptability questionnaire in a cross-sectional study. Self-samples from a subset of these women were analyzed for somatic mutations using next-generation sequencing (NGS), targeting a panel of 47 genes. A total of 61 (88.4%) out of 69 eligible women participated in the study. The overall self-sampling experience was rated good or very good (N\u2009=\u200955, 90.2%). Most of the women were confident about correctly sampling (N\u2009=\u200958, 95.1%), and most reported no or mild pain (N\u2009=\u200956, 91.8%). During self-sample collection, most women reported feeling calm and comfortable and experiencing safety, privacy, and normality. In a pilot study using a subset of 15 samples, five somatic variants were identified in four self-samples (4/15, 26.7%) in ACVR2A, ARID1A, APC, and KMT2D. During follow-up, three out of four women with variants detected in the self-sample underwent prophylactic hysterectomy at a median of 9.1\u2009months, while one out of four developed endometrial cancer after 3.9\u2009years since the collection of the sample. Self-sampling is well-accepted and well-tolerated in women with Lynch syndrome and could potentially reduce some barriers associated with gynaecological surveillance. Further research is needed to evaluate the feasibility of implementing cervicovaginal self-collection and the accuracy of molecular testing for gynaecological surveillance in women with Lynch syndrome.",

A comprehensive search was performed until August 31, 2024 in multiple databases and sources. From 21 studies, 65,228 apparent early-stage EC patients were identified: 370 with macrometastases (MAC), 526 with micrometastases (MM), 2,138 with isolated tumor cells (ITCs), and 62,194 with negative nodes. Findings indicated: 1) The MM group had a lower risk of recurrence or progression (R/P) than the MAC group (risk ratio [RR]=0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.31-0.78; p=0.002), higher risk than the negative nodes group (RR=2.07; 95% CI=1.59-2.68; p<0.001), and similar risk to the ITC group (RR=0.67; 95% CI=0.44-1.02; p=0.060). 2) The MM group had higher 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) (RR=1.36; 95% CI=1.21-1.52; p<0.001) and overall survival (OS) (RR=1.22; 95% CI=1.09-1.37; p<0.001) than the MAC group, similar to the ITC and negative nodes groups. 3) The ITC group had a lower R/P risk and higher 3-year PFS/OS than the MAC group, similar to the negative nodes group. 4) AT reduced the R/P risk in the MM group (RR=0.41; 95% CI=0.22-0.76; p=0.005) and increased 3-year OS in the ITC group (RR=1.06; 95% CI=1.04-1.08; p<0.001). Early-stage EC with LVNM had better prognostic outcomes than MAC, and AT may improve outcomes of LVNM patients.

      "abstract": "Gynecological cancers, including cervical, ovarian, and endometrial malignancies, remain a significant global health burden, exacerbated by disparities in access to preventive measures such as HPV vaccination and routine screening. The cGAS/STING signaling pathway, a pivotal mechanism in innate immunity, detects cytosolic DNA from pathogens or cellular damage, triggering immune responses via type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines. This pathway's dual role in gynecological cancers, either promoting antitumor immunity or facilitating tumor immune evasion, makes it a compelling target for innovative therapies. The article outlines cGAS/STING's influence on tumor microenvironments, immune surveillance, and inflammation, with emphasis on molecular mechanisms driving cancer progression. It explores interactions between DNA damage response pathways and immune modulation, highlighting the impact of cGAS/STING activation or suppression in ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers. The therapeutic potential of STING agonists, PARP inhibitors, and targeted immunotherapies is reviewed, demonstrating how these approaches can boost immune responses, counteract chemotherapy resistance, and improve patient outcomes. The study also discusses strategies for leveraging cGAS/STING signaling to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies and address tumor-mediated immune suppression, providing insights into future directions for personalized cancer treatments.",

High throughput screening (HTS) of cervical and endometrial cancer in vitro models offers a promising avenue for drug repurposing and broadening patient treatment options. Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell-based screenings have limited capabilities to capture crucial multicellular interactions, that are improved upon in three dimensional (3D) multicellular tissue engineered models. However, manual fabrication of the 3D platforms is both time consuming and subject to variability. Thus, the goal of this study was to utilize automated cell dispensing to fabricate 3D cell-based HTS platforms using the HP D100 Single Cell Dispenser to dispense cervical and endometrial cancer cells.",

      "abstract": "Mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma is a rare subtype of endometrial cancer, characterized by its histological and molecular overlap with mesonephric carcinoma of the uterine cervix. This study presents a unique case of mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma in the endometrium, accompanied by adjacent mesonephric-like\u00a0hyperplasia and atypical mesonephric-like hyperplasia. Histologically, the transition from mesonephric metaplasia to adenocarcinoma was evident, and molecular analysis revealed shared mutations, including KRAS (p.G12D) in both atypical hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma, and a novel BCOR mutation (p.A1314Nfs*49) in the adenocarcinoma. These findings suggest a M\u00fcllerian origin of mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma via mesonephric transdifferentiation, challenging the traditional understanding of mesonephric histogenesis. The identification of these mutations underscores the potential for targeted therapies, particularly in cases with BCOR and KRAS mutations. This study is the first to document preneoplastic lesions in mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma, offering new insights into its pathogenesis and therapeutic implications.",

      "abstract": "Mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), also known as high-grade microsatellite instability (MSI-H), is a well-established biomarker for predicting the immunotherapy response in endometrial cancer (EC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) has also emerged as an important quantitative genomic biomarker for assessing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) can be used to assess MSI and TMB, the high costs, low sample throughput, and significant DNA requirements make NGS impractical for routine clinical screening. In this study, an interpretable, multi-stage attention deep learning (DL) network is introduced to predict pathological subtypes, MSI, TP53 mutations, and TMB directly from low-cost, routinely used histopathological whole slide images of EC and CRC slides. Experimental results showed that this method consistently outperformed seven state-of-the-art approaches in cancer subtyping and molecular status prediction across EC and CRC datasets. Fisher's Least Significant Difference test confirmed a strong correlation between model predictions and actual molecular statuses (MSI, TP53, and TMB) (p<0.001). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier disease-free survival analysis revealed that CRC patients with model-predicted high TMB had significantly longer disease-free survival than those with low TMB (p<0.05). These findings demonstrate that the proposed DL-based approach holds significant potential for directly predicting immunotherapy-related pathological diagnoses and molecular statuses from routine WSIs, supporting personalized cancer immunotherapy treatment decisions in EC and CRC.",

BLU-222 demonstrated robust antitumor activity in select CCNE1-high ovarian and endometrial cancer models. We used a combination of CRISPR whole genome screens coupled with targeted genetic and pharmacologic approaches in ovarian and endometrial cell lines to identify biological determinants to predict BLU-222 monotherapy activity. Rb and p16 expression were biomarkers that enriched for CDK2-dependency/BLU-222 sensitivity in CCNE1 overexpressed, non-amplified cells. Further, intact Rb and low p16 expression predicted a BLU-222 and CDK4/6 inhibitor combination response. BLU-222 demonstrated robust activity in combination with carboplatin or paclitaxel in CCNE1-aberrant models, rendering chemotherapy-resistant tumors strongly sensitive to the combination. These findings demonstrate that response to CDK2 inhibition by BLU-222 can be further predicted using a combinatorial biomarker signature that could refine patient selection criteria in CCNE1-high patients and support clinical development.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide, with rising incidence, particularly in economically developed countries where obesity and type 2 diabetes are prevalent risk factors. EC comprises various histological subtypes with distinct behaviors: Type I tumors are generally estrogen-driven with favorable prognosis, while Type II tumors are hormone-independent, aggressive, and associated with poorer outcomes. Dysregulation of the cell cycle, particularly through cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their regulators like Cyclin D1 (CCND1), plays a crucial role in EC progression and recurrence. Cyclin D1 overexpression is often observed in the early stages of endometrioid carcinoma and complex hyperplasia, marking potential early carcinogenic events, while lower expression levels are common in high-grade subtypes like serous carcinoma. Although CDK inhibitors targeting Cyclin D1/CDK4/6 complexes have shown therapeutic potential in cancers such as breast and lung, their role in EC remains underexplored. This study integrates immunohistochemical evaluations of Cyclin D1 expression in EC patient samples with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to assess its prognostic significance across EC subtypes. By correlating molecular, histopathological, and clinical outcomes, we aim to clarify the impact of Cyclin D1 dysregulation on EC progression and recurrence. Our findings may inform more personalized therapeutic approaches, particularly for high-grade and treatment-resistant forms of EC.",

ARI modulates key pathways like PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, induces apoptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress, and overcomes drug resistance by inhibiting P-glycoprotein activity and expression. It exhibits tumor-suppressive effects in\u00a0vivo and synergizes with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Retrospective population studies suggest ARI's prolactin-sparing properties may reduce the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast and endometrial cancer compared to antipsychotics with stronger dopamine receptor blockade. Additionally, ARI's ability to target multiple Hallmarks of Cancer highlights its promise as a repurposed anticancer agent. However, current evidence is primarily preclinical and observational, with limited clinical validation. Large-scale cohort studies and prospective trials are essential to confirm its efficacy and address translational challenges. By bridging these gaps, ARI could emerge as a valuable adjunctive therapy in oncology, leveraging its safety profile and versatility to address unmet needs in cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Fertility-sparing treatments are becoming increasingly important for patients worldwide with atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) and early endometrial cancer (EC). The primary aim of these treatments is to achieve complete regression (CR). Accurately predicting CR and applying effective treatment strategies throughout the process are crucial for successful fertility preservation in these patients. In our cohort, we included 155 patients and selected six radiomic features strongly correlated with CR from over 1500 MRI-based features. Tn area under the curve (AUC) value of MR score achieved up to 0.871. We then incorporated MR scores and clinical factors into a nomogram, demonstrating a strong predictive performance. With the introduction of MR score, the AUC value reached as high as 0.871, indicating a significant improvement in net benefit. In summary, we introduced an innovative MR score and developed a nomogram that significantly improves predictive accuracy for the likelihood of CR in patients seeking fertility preservation. Moving forward, we plan to establish a multicenter patient cohort to further refine this model and support its broader implementation in clinical practice following thorough evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Disruptions in uterine tissue function contribute to disorders such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, endometrial cancer, and fibroids, which all significantly impact health and fertility. Advances in transcriptomics, particularly single-cell RNA sequencing, have revolutionized uterine biological research by revealing the cellular heterogeneity and molecular mechanisms underlying disease states. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics have mapped endometrial and myometrial cellular landscapes, which helped to identify critical cell types, signaling pathways, and phase-specific dynamics. Said transcriptomic technologies also identified stromal and immune cell dysfunctions, such as fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transitions and impaired macrophage activity, which drive fibrosis, chronic inflammation, and lesion persistence in endometriosis. For endometrial cancer, scRNA-seq uncovered tumor microenvironmental complexities, identifying cancer-associated fibroblast subtypes and immune cell profiles contributing to progression and therapeutic resistance. Similarly, studies on adenomyosis highlighted disrupted signaling pathways, including Wnt and VEGF, and novel progenitor cell populations linked to tissue invasion and neuroinflammation, while single-cell approaches characterized smooth muscle and fibroblast subpopulations in uterine fibroids, elucidating their roles in extracellular matrix remodeling and signaling pathways like ERK and mTOR. Despite challenges such as scalability and reproducibility, single-cell transcriptomic approaches may have potential applications in biomarker discovery, therapeutic target identification, and personalized medicine in gynecological disorders.",

      "abstract": "Accumulating studies have revealed that microRNAs serve significant regulatory for endometrial carcinoma (EC) tumorigenesis and progression. The specific objective of this investigation is to seek the potential function of miR-1264 in EC and clarified the underlying mechanism. Determination of miR-1264 and MSH2 expression in EC tissues or cell lines was performed by RT-qPCR and/or western blot assay. The malignant behaviors of EC cells were verified by CCK-8 assay, EdU staining, wound healing assay and Transwell assay, respectively. Besides, the interaction between miR-1264 and MSH2 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. MiR-1264 exhibited high levels in EC tissues and has been found to be correlated with a poor prognosis in EC patients. Functionally, silencing miR-1264 resulted in inhibiting the aggressiveness behaviors of HEC-1\u00a0A and KLE cells, while forced miR-1264 expression executed opposite effects. Mechanistically, miR-1264 directly targeted and suppressed MSH2 expression. Functional rescue experiments further validated that overexpression of MSH2 diminished malignant behaviors of EC cells and greatly reversed the promoting effects of miR-1264 on the malignant behaviors of EC cells. MiR-1264 acted as an oncogene in EC, promoting aggressiveness behaviors of EC cells by inhibiting MSH2. This study provided novel insights into anti-cancer treatment and a theoretical basis for potential therapeutic targets of EC.",

We analyzed LNG-IUS use prevalence among women aged 18-50 using a weighted statistical analysis of the 2017-2019 National Survey of Family Growth. Summary statistics were stratified by race and ethnic group, known EC sociodemographic and health risk factors, and assessed statistically with bivariate Rao-Scott chi-square tests. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to explore LNG-IUS use predictors. Current LNG-IUS use in the US was 6.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.9-8.1%). LNG-IUS use was lower in Hispanic women compared to White women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5-1.0]. Compared to women with \u2264high school education, LNG-IUS use was higher for women with \u2265college degree (AOR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.3-3.1). Parous (AOR 2.6, 95% CI: 1.7-3.9) and insured (AOR 1.7. 95% CI: 1.0-3.1) women had higher odds of LNG-IUS use, whereas women with diabetes (AOR 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.7) had lower odds of LNG-IUS use. No differences in LNG-IUS use were observed by EC risk factors of women's body mass index, age of menarche, hypertension, and personal history of cancer. More research is needed to establish the potential benefits of LNG-IUS use on EC, which will further highlight potential opportunities for population-level primary prevention to address the growing incidence of EC.",

The relationship of fat tissue distribution in the body with these outcomes is less well known. Using data from the UK Biobank imaging substudy, we evaluated the prospective relationship between MRI-derived measurements of adipose tissue distribution and the risk of the major site-specific cancers associated with obesity. Methods Between 2014 and 2023, MRI measurements on adipose tissue distribution and volume were obtained from 49,044 (52.2% women) cancer-free UK Biobank participants. Quantitative MRI data included volumes of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues (VAT and ASAT), total abdominal fat/height squared (TAT/h2), and muscle fat infiltration (MFI). Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for cancer-specific risk factors were used to generate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Incident cancer cases of the breast (N+179), endometrium (n=30), colorectum (n=145), and kidney (n=50) were ascertained over a median follow-up of 4.5 years. In women, VAT, TAT/h2, and MFI were positively associated with risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, and ASAT was associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer. In men, VAT and TAT/h2 were positively associated with risk of colorectal cancer, while ASAT was associated with increased risk of kidney cancer. Conclusions The present study showed that increasing volumes of VAT, ASAT and MFI were associated with cancer at specific organ-sites, indicating a potential role for adipose tissue distribution in influencing cancer risk. Impact Both visceral and subcutaneous fat may have an impact on the risk of certain cancers.",

Disparate incidence and mortality rates affect many populations including racial/ethnic minority women and women who live in rural communities. These populations are more likely to experience delays in care due to multi-dimensional factors ranging from lack of awareness between the women and their non-gynecologic providers to lack of access to health care and/or to gynecologic oncologists. Multiple layers of intervention will be needed to mitigate the inequities, including policy changes, advocacy to change insurance coverage, and network inclusion of gynecologic oncologists.

While abnormal cholesterol metabolism has been implicated in EC progression, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we identified lanosterol synthase (LSS) as a key mediator in cholesterol metabolism associated with EC. We found that LSS is significantly upregulated in EC tissues. Functional assays revealed that LSS promotes cell proliferation and migration, inhibits apoptosis, and drives tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, LSS exerts dual effects by accumulating cholesterol esters, thereby enhancing EC cell growth, and activating the MAPK/JNK signaling pathway. Importantly, inhibition of LSS with the specific inhibitor Ro 48-8071 not only reduced EC cell proliferation and suppressed xenograft tumor growth but also inhibited the growth of patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters (PTCs). These findings establish LSS as a novel oncogene in EC, promoting tumor progression through MAPK/JNK signaling activation and cholesterol ester accumulation, and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting LSS in EC treatment.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a known risk factor for uterine endometrial cancer (UCEC), but its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) could provide insights into these mechanisms and reveal potential therapeutic targets. Differential miRNA expression was analyzed in plasma exosomes from 15 PCOS and 15 control samples. Survival analysis assessed the prognostic value of these miRNAs in UCEC. MiRNA-target gene interaction networks and gene co-expression analyses were used to explore molecular mechanisms. Validation was performed using experimental data from Ishikawa cells treated with six candidate drugs. Among the 15 differentially expressed miRNAs, 12 were up-regulated and 3 were down-regulated in PCOS. Twelve of these miRNAs were associated with UCEC overall survival, with miR-142, miR-424, and miR-331 acting as protective factors, while the remaining 9 miRNAs were identified as risk factors. MiRNA-target network highlighted key genes such as PHF8, LCOR, SFT2D3, E2F1, and ESR1, which were found to be prognostic for patient survival. Further gene expression and co-expression analyses based on miR-424 and miR-330 expression revealed significant alterations in gene expression and cellular processes related to UCEC. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis identified potential causal relationships between AURKA gene expression and PCOS or UCEC. Testosterone and estradiol might have adverse roles in UCEC, while drugs like troglitazone, valproic acid, retinoic acid, and progesterone demonstrated various effects on gene expression and cellular processes. Our findings suggest that aberrant miRNA expression, particularly miR-330 and miR-424, may play crucial roles in UCEC progression. The identified miRNAs and candidate drugs may serve as potential therapeutic targets for UCEC, but further research is required to validate and explore their clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is a common type of cancer in women, with endometrial adenocarcinoma (EA) being the most common type. Monitoring the expression levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), the protein levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and soluble programmed death ligand 1 (sPD-L1), and their differences in patients with various pathological characteristics is beneficial for accurately evaluating the disease stage and differentiation degree of patients in clinical practice. The aim of the present study was to assess the expression levels of STAT3, and the protein levels of IL-6 and sPD-L1 in EA. In the present retrospective study, data were retrieved from the medical records of 137 patients with EA who received surgical treatment at The First Affiliated Hospital of Hebei North University from January 2017 to December 2022. Of the 137 cases, 90 met the inclusion criteria. The patients with EA were matched with a cohort of 30 patients with atypical endometrial hyperplasia in a ratio of 3:1. Among the 90 patients with EA, 30 patients with well-differentiated EA were matched with 30 patients with moderately differentiated EA and 30 patients with poorly differentiated EA in a 1:1:1 ratio. Expression level of STAT3, and protein levels of IL-6 and sPD-L1 were recorded preoperatively and compared between patients with different pathological characteristics [such as differentiation degree, disease stage, depth of myometrial invasion and lymph node metastasis (LNM)] and prognosis. Levels of IL-6, STAT3 and sPD-L1 in the observation group were significantly higher compared with the control group (P<0.001). Additionally, there were significant differences in IL-6, STAT3 and sPD-L1 levels between patients with different differentiation degrees, disease stages, myometrial invasion and LNM (P<0.001). The increase in IL-6, STAT3 and sPD-L1 levels were significantly associated with the decrease in the differentiation degree and the increase in the disease stage, depth of myometrial invasion and LNM (P<0.001). IL-6, STAT3 and sPD-L1 levels in patients with a poor prognosis were significantly higher compared with patients with good prognoses (P<0.001). Overall, the expression levels of STAT3, and the protein levels of IL-6 and sPD-L1 were increased in patients with EA compared with in those without EA, and their increase is associated with the pathological characteristics of the disease. The levels of these indices may be detected in clinical practices to evaluate the disease and predict the prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Dysregulated alternative splicing has been closely linked to the initiation and progression of tumors. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanisms through which splicing factors regulate endometrial cancer progression are still not fully understood. This study demonstrated elevated expression of the splicing factor SNRPB in endometrial cancer samples. Furthermore, our findings indicate that high SNRPB expression is correlated with poor prognosis in patients with endometrial cancer. Functionally, SNRPB inhibition hindered the proliferative and metastatic capacities of endometrial cancer cells. Mechanistically, we revealed that SNRPB knockdown decreased POLD1 expression and that POLD1 intron 22 was retained after SNRPB silencing in endometrial cancer cells, as determined via RNA sequencing data analysis. The retained intron 22 of POLD1 created a premature termination codon, leading to the absence of amino acids 941-1,107 and the loss of the site of interaction with PCNA, which is essential for POLD1 enzyme activity. In addition, POLD1 depletion decreased the increase in the malignancy of endometrial cancer cells overexpressing SNRPB. Furthermore, miR-654-5p was found to bind directly to the 3' untranslated region of SNRPB, resulting in SNRPB expression inhibition in endometrial cancer. Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated SNRPB inhibition led to a decrease in the growth capacity of a cell-derived xenograft model and a patient with endometrial cancer-derived xenograft model. Overall, SNRPB promotes the efficient splicing of POLD1 by regulating intron retention, ultimately contributing to high POLD1 expression in endometrial cancer. The oncogenic SNRPB-POLD1 axis is an interesting therapeutic target for endometrial cancer, and antisense oligonucleotide-mediated silencing of SNRPB may constitute a promising therapeutic approach for treating patients with endometrial cancer.",

      "abstract": "Subcutaneous metastasis of endometrial cancer (EC) is an exceedingly rare phenomenon, and the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain insufficiently elucidated. We report the case of a 69-year-old multiparous woman diagnosed with stage IB EC, histologically classified as grade 3 endometrioid and clear cell carcinoma. Approximately one month following primary surgical intervention, the patient developed subcutaneous masses on her back, axilla, and buttock. Histopathological evaluation, in conjunction with PET-CT, confirmed a systemic recurrence of EC. She was subsequently treated with a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin, with a remarkable therapeutic response; after six cycles of chemotherapy, nearly all metastatic sites exhibited complete resolution. She was then transitioned to a regimen of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab. However, one week after the initiation of this treatment, she developed hepatic encephalopathy, which was presumed to be lenvatinib-induced, and was successfully managed with aminoleban injections, resulting in a full recovery of consciousness. Follow-up diagnostic imaging confirmed a complete response to therapy. The patient is currently receiving pembrolizumab as maintenance therapy and has remained recurrence-free for 18 months. While no standardized therapeutic protocol exists for the management of subcutaneous metastasis in EC due to its extremely low incidence, this report provides evidence for the potential efficacy of chemotherapy combined with targeted immunotherapy in the treatment of unresectable subcutaneous metastases in EC.",

This review provides a comprehensive summary of DNA methylation-based early diagnostic biomarkers in EC, with a focus on recent valuable research findings published in the past two years. The discussion is organized according to sample sources, including cervical scraping, vaginal fluid, urine, blood, and tissue. Additionally, we outline the role of DNA methylation in EC risk assessment, such as carcinogenesis risk, feasibility of fertility preservation approaches, and overall prognosis, aiming to provide personalized treatment decisions for patients. Finally, we review researches on DNA methylation in resistance to first-line treatment of EC and the development of new drugs, and envision the future applications of DNA methylation in EC.",

      "abstract": "Immunotherapy represents a groundbreaking therapeutic approach, based on the immune system's intrinsic capacity to interfere with tumor progression, that opens the horizons in the treatment of endometrial cancer. However, the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy is hampered by the development of resistance in patients. The resistance to immunotherapy is multifactorial mechanism, encompassed genetic and epigenetic alterations in tumor cells modulating immune checkpoint molecules, resulted in escaping immune surveillance. The tumor microenvironment can orchestrate an immunosuppressive milieu, attenuating the immune response and facilitating tumor progression. To overcome immunotherapeutic resistance in endometrial cancer we must bring to light the mechanisms of intricate interplay between neoplastic cells, the host immune system, and the tumor microenvironment. The identification of predictive biomarkers for immunotherapeutic response and the innovative agents capable of reversing resistance pathways must be developed. Our review summarizes accumulated data on the role of cells of the tumor microenvironment and their regulatory molecules in the mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors, including resistance to therapy. Major question we raise here - which group of patients is the most favorable to achieve durable immunotherapy response in endometrial cancer?",

Aberrant O-GlcNAcylation has been observed in many cancers including endometrial cancer (EC), a common malignancy in women. However, clinical characterization of dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation homeostasis in EC and interrogating its molecular mechanism remain incomplete. Here we report that O-GlcNAcylation level is positively correlated with EC histologic grade in a Chinese cohort containing 219 tumors, validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. Increasing O-GlcNAcylation in patient-derived endometrial epithelial organoids promotes proliferation and stem-like cell properties, whereas decreasing O-GlcNAcylation limits the growth of endometrial cancer organoids. CRISPR screen and biochemical characterization reveal that tumor suppressor F-box only protein 31 (FBXO31) regulates O-GlcNAcylation homeostasis in EC by ubiquitinating the O-GlcNAc transferase OGT. Downregulation of O-GlcNAcylation impedes EC tumor formation in mouse models. Collectively, our study highlights O-GlcNAcylation as a useful stratification marker and a therapeutic vulnerability for the advanced, poorly differentiated EC cases.",

In cervical and endometrial cancer, the introduction of immunotherapy has radically changed the treatment algorithm, especially for advanced disease.

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common tumor of the female reproductive system. Its incidence is rising worldwide. Bone metastasis (BMs) in EC is rarely reported, and is seen in only 0.8% of patients. Once bone metastasis develops, it often indicates a poor prognosis. Current research on the bone metastasis of primary tumors suggests that tumor cells primarily colonize bones through hematogenous metastasis and are stimulated to grow by the bone microenvironment. However, the biological mechanism of bone metastasis in EC remains unclear. In this study, we aim to determine the changes in gene expression profiles in EC bone metastasis and explore the transcriptomic differences between metastatic and primary lesions. We collected one primary EC case and two bone metastasis tumors for transcriptomic analysis. The analysis revealed that numerous genes are involved in regulating the cell cycle and proliferation. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that these genes are involved in the regulation of post-translational modification, protein turnover, and signal transduction mechanisms. E2F1, MCM2, RFC2, and ICAM1 are involved in the metastasis and progression of EC with bone metastasis (ECBM). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis indicates significant changes in the Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation, and in the cell adhesion signaling pathway. Numerous transcription factors, including SOX2, NUSAP1, and ACTA1, which promote tumor development, are involved in regulating the expression of cell cycle control genes. Survival curve analysis of high-expression cell cycle genes, including P27, P19, and CDK1, in ECBM showed that elevated levels of these genes are associated with poorer patient survival. Our research identified genes and key signaling pathways associated with bone metastasis. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of bone metastasis in EC.",

      "abstract": "Advanced-stage endometrial cancer patients typically receive a combination of platinum and paclitaxel chemotherapy. However, limited treatment options are available for those with recurrent disease, and there is a need to identify alternative treatment options for the advanced setting. Our goal was to evaluate the preclinical efficacy and mechanism of action of the anticancer drug Oklahoma Nitrone-007 (OKN-007) alone and in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in endometrial cancer. The effect of OKN-007 on the metabolic viability of endometrial cancer cells in both two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) cultures, as well as on clonogenic growth, in\u00a0vitro was assessed. We also evaluated OKN-007 in\u00a0vivo using an intraperitoneal xenograft model and targeted gene expression profiling to determine the molecular mechanism and gene expression programs altered by OKN-007. Our results showed that endometrial cancer cells were generally sensitive to OKN-007 in both 2D and 3D cultures. OKN-007 displayed a reduction in 3D spheroid and clonogenic growth. Subsequent targeted gene expression profiling revealed that OKN-007 significantly downregulated the immunosuppressive immunometabolic regulatory enzyme indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) (-11.27-fold change) and modulated upstream inflammatory pathways that regulate IDO1 expression (interferon-gamma [IFN-\u03b3], Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription [JAK-STAT], transforming growth factor beta [TGF-\u03b2], and nuclear factor-kappa B [NF-\u03baB]), downstream IDO1 effector pathways (mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] and aryl hydrocarbon receptor [AhR]), and altered T cell signaling pathways. OKN-007 treatment reduced IDO1, sulfatase 2 (SULF2), and TGF-\u03b2 protein expression in\u00a0vivo and inhibited TGF-\u03b2, NF-\u03baB, and AhR-mediated nuclear signaling in\u00a0vitro. These findings indicate that OKN-007 surmounts proinflammatory, immunosuppressive, and protumorigenic pathways and is a promising approach for the effective treatment of endometrial cancer. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Women with advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer have limited therapeutic options. Oklahoma Nitrone-007 (OKN-007), which has minimal toxicity and is currently being evaluated in early-phase clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, is a potential new strategy for the treatment of endometrial cancer.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is a malignancy of the endometrial epithelium. The prevalence and mortality rates associated with the disease are on the rise globally. A total of 20 cases of type I EC tissues were collected for transcriptomic sequencing, our findings indicate that PAX2 is highly expressed in EC tissues and is closely related to the pathogenesis of EC. PAX2 is a member of the paired homeobox domain family and has been linked to the development of a number of different tumours. In normal endometrial tissue, PAX2 is methylated; however, in EC, it is demethylated. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on its role in EC. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis revealed a regulatory relationship between PAX2 and CD133, which in turn affects the activity of AKT1. CD133 is a well-known marker of tumor stem cells and is involved in tumor initiation, metastasis, recurrence, and drug resistance; AKT1 promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis and is considered a major promoter of many types of cancer. Nevertheless, further investigation is required to ascertain whether PAX2 affects the progression of EC by regulating the CD133-AKT1 pathway. The present study demonstrated that PAX2 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion and adhesion, and inhibited apoptosis. Its mechanism of action was found to be the inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, promotion of glycolysis, increase in mitochondrial copy number, and increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hexokinase, as well as the concentration of mitochondrial calcium ions. This was achieved through the promotion of CD133 expression and the phosphorylation of AKT1. In conjunction with the aforementioned regulatory pathways, the progression of EC is facilitated.",

      "abstract": "With the incorporation of immune checkpoint inhibitors into the treatment of endometrial cancer (EC), a deeper understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment is critical. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are considered favorable prognostic factors for EC, but the significance of their spatial distribution remains unclear. B cell receptor repertoire analysis performed using six TLS samples located at various distances from the tumor showed that TLSs in distal areas had more shared B cell clones with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. To comprehensively investigate the distribution of TLSs, we developed an artificial intelligence model to detect TLSs and determine their spatial locations in whole-slide images. Our model effectively quantified TLSs, and TLSs were detected in 69% of the patients with EC. We identified them as proximal or distal to the tumor margin and demonstrated that patients with distal TLSs (dTLSs) had significantly prolonged overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) across multiple cohorts [hazard ratio (HR), 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.36-0.88; p\u2009=\u20090.01 for overall survival; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40-0.84; p\u2009=\u20090.004 for PFS]. When analyzed by molecular subtype, patients with dTLSs in the copy-number-high EC subtype had significantly longer PFS (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29-0.91; p\u2009=\u20090.02). Moreover, patients with dTLSs had a higher response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors (87.5 vs. 41.7%) and a trend toward improved PFS. Our findings indicate that the functions and prognostic implications of TLSs may vary with their locations, and dTLSs may serve as prognostic factors and predictors of treatment efficacy. This may facilitate personalized therapy for patients with EC.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is the second most frequent gynecological malignancy and the sixth most common women's cancer worldwide. EC incidence rate is increasing rapidly. Apart from the classical, we should consider angiogenesis and hypoxia-related genes as a reason for EC manifestation and progression. We compared the patterns of HIF1A, EPAS1, and VEGFA (genes of interest - GOIs) mRNA expression in 92 cases. HIF1A and VEGFA levels were higher in EC patients than in controls. VEGFA differed significantly between controls and both tumor grades G2 and G3, and we observed a positive correlation for HIF1A and VEGFA with EC grading. VEGFA levels were significantly higher in post-menopausal compared to pre-menopausal patients. All GOIs demonstrated strong correlations in pre-menopausal cases and weak correlations in post-menopausal cases. A positive correlation was observed in pre-menopausal controls for all GOIs and in post-menopausal patients for only EPAS1 and VEGFA. HIF1A and EPAS1 positively correlated with VEGFA in post-menopausal EC cases. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that menopause, body mass index (BMI), and HIF1A expression are significant stimulating factors for EC occurrence. HIF1A levels were higher in EC patients after BMI and comorbidity number adjustment. The gene-to-gene relation could be seen as either a diagnostic or a therapeutic target in EC. Physicians should inform patients about modifiable risk factors such as BMI. Second, more attention should be paid to diagnosing patients with comorbidities in older age and after menopause. These factors should be considered in designing angiogenesis and hypoxia-related gene-targeting therapies.",

      "abstract": "The presence of cancer stem cells is linked to aggressive disease and higher risk of recurrence, and multiple markers have been proposed to detect cancer stem cells. However, a detailed evaluation of the expression patterns and the prognostic value of markers relevant for endometrial cancer is lacking. As organoid models are suggested to be enriched in cancer stem cells, such models may prove valuable to define tissue-specific cancer stem cells. To address this, imaging mass cytometry and multiplex single-cell analyses were performed on an endometrial cancer patient series including both tumor biopsies and corresponding patient-derived organoids. An antibody panel focused on cancer stem cell markers was used to identify cancer stem cell phenotypes. Over 70% of epithelial cells in the tumor biopsies expressed at least one putative cancer stem cell marker. We identified distinct cancer cell phenotypes with heterogeneous expression within individual patients and between patient samples. Few differences in the distribution of cancer cell phenotypes were observed between tumor biopsies and corresponding organoids. Cells expressing aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) were more prevalent in high-grade tumors, while expression of CD44 was more prevalent in grade 1 tumors. Spatial analysis revealed significantly less interaction between ALDH1- and CD44-expressing cells. Gene expression data was used to further investigate selected markers. CD44 gene expression was associated with a favorable prognosis and was further validated using immunohistochemistry. High expression of CD44 was significantly associated with better survival. The general high expression of proposed stem cell markers may indicate alternative roles for these in endometrial cancer.",

      "abstract": "Immunotherapy has gained approval for use in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), yet only a subset of patients (10-20%) experience meaningful benefits, underscoring the urgent need for more effective therapeutic approaches. This work discovers a distinct HDAC7-high SCLC phenotype characterized by enhanced proliferative potential, which recurs across various subtypes and serves as a predictor of poorer survival outcomes. By analyzing public datasets, this work finds a strong correlation between c-Myc and HDAC7. RNA sequencing and cellular experiments show that XPO1 is a key regulator in the HDAC7/c-Myc axis. HDAC7 promotes \u03b2-catenin deacetylation, phosphorylation modulation, nuclear translocation, and formation of the \u03b2-catenin/TCF/LEF1 complex, which binds to c-Myc and XPO1 promoters. Activation of the HDAC7/\u03b2-catenin pathway upregulates c-Myc and XPO1 expression, while c-Myc also boosts XPO1 expression. Given the difficulty in targeting c-Myc directly, this work tests selinexor and vorinostat in SCLC xenograft models, with selinexor showing superior results. High HDAC7 expression is linked to increased SCLC proliferation, poorer prognosis, and enhanced sensitivity to selinexor in SCLC cell lines and organoid models. Collectively, this work uncovers a novel HDAC7/c-Myc/XPO1 signaling axis that promotes SCLC progression, suggesting that HDAC7 may warrant further investigation as a potential biomarker for assessing selinexor sensitivity in SCLC patients.",

HNF1B is a critical transcription element in vertebrate proliferation and oncogenesis, which has been shown to play roles in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Our previous results have identified HNF1B as a tumor suppressor that could inhibit the malignant progression of prostate cancer. Yet there is no pan-carcinomatosis analysis of HNF1B, which could help us better understand common and unique underlying mechanisms in mankind knubs to enhance novel and competent treatment. Here, in our research, we evaluated the utterance pattern and explored the function of HNF1B in 33 knub categories using the data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and CLNICAL PROTEOMICTUMOR ANALYSIS CONSORTIUM (CPTAC) dataset. We found different HNF1B roles in various cancer types. HNF1B was upregulated in CHOL, STAD, KIRP, and THCA, and was downregulated in GBM, KICH, COAD, KIRC, LUSC, SARC, PAAD, and TGCT. Prognostic analyses indicated that higher HNF1B displayed better illness outcomes in BLCA, READ, and PRAD, while poorer outcomes in LUSC and THYM. HNF1B mutation was most frequent in endometrial cancer but was not associated with disease prognosis. It was discovered that HNF1B utterance relevant to endothelial cell penetration status in BLCA, ESCA, LUAD, LUSC, and TGCT, and carcinomatosis-associated fibroblast infiltration was observed in ESCA, KIRC, LIHC, and TGCT. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis disclosed that metabolism-related functions were implicated in the function of HNF1B. Taken together, our pan- carcinomatosis analysis showed the complicated roles of HNF1B in a variety of carcinomatoses, being able to improve the extensive comprehension of HNF1B's role in tumorigenesis.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is one of the leading causes of mortality in women. Metabolic disorders, such as abnormal fatty acid metabolism (FAM), are considered to be indicators of tumorigenesis. However, to the best of our knowledge, the relationship between EC and FAM remains unclear. The process of FAM is associated with the function of immune cells, thus samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas were grouped according to immune infiltration levels. Subsequently, prognostic gene signatures were constructed based on selected FAM\u2011associated genes. The signature effect was validated, and enrichment analyses were conducted based on sample classification. Nomograms were used to predict survival, merging clinical data and the gene signature. Samples were divided into high\u2011 and low\u2011risk groups based on the gene signature. The survival status, clinical characteristics, enrichment analysis and immune infiltration were significantly different between high\u2011 and low\u2011risk groups. According to the nomogram, low microsatellite instability\u2011high as well as a high tumor mutation burden can be observed in the low\u2011nomo\u2011score group. Immune checkpoint inhibitor\u2011associated genes were differentially expressed between groups and 35 sensitive compounds were identified. Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis in EC revealed potential roles of FAM in tumorigenesis, the tumor microenvironment and prognosis, suggesting that FAM\u2011associated signatures are promising biomarkers for EC. These findings may improve the understanding of FAM in EC and pave the way for a more accurate assessment of prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals face an elevated risk of cancer in comparison with the general population. This increased risk is primarily attributed to an imbalanced exposure to modifiable risk factors and a limited adherence to cancer screening programmes, stemming from historical social and economic marginalisation. Consequently, these factors contribute to poorer clinical outcomes in terms of cancer diagnosis and mortality. A focal point of interest is the potential carcinogenic effect of gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). It is crucial to recognise that GAHT serves as an essential, life-saving treatment for TGD individuals. Therefore, if a demonstrated direct correlation between GAHT and elevated cancer risk emerges, essential shared decision-making discussions should occur between oncology practitioners and patients. This narrative review aims to collect and discuss evidence regarding potential correlations between GAHT and the most prevalent tumours known to be influenced by sex hormones. The objective is to comprehend how these potential carcinogenic effects impact health and inform health interventions for TGD individuals. Unfortunately, the scarcity of epidemiological data on cancer incidence in the TGD population persists due to the absence of sexual orientation and gender identity data collection in cancer centres. Consequently, in most cases, establishing a positive or negative correlation between GAHT and cancer risk remains speculative. There is an urgent need for concerted efforts from researchers and clinicians worldwide to overcome barriers and enhance cancer prevention and care in this specific population.",

At birth, FRT epithelium is highly malleable, allowing differentiation into various epithelial types, but the regulatory pathways guiding these early cell fate decisions are unclear. Here, we use neonatal mouse endometrial organoids and assembloid coculture models to investigate how innate cellular plasticity and external mesenchymal signals influence epithelial differentiation. Our findings demonstrate that uterine epithelium undergoes marked age-dependent changes, transitioning from a highly plastic state capable of forming both monolayered and multilayered structures to a more restricted fate as development progresses. Interestingly, parallels emerge between the developmental plasticity of neonatal uterine epithelium and pathological conditions such as endometrial cancer, where similar regulatory mechanisms may reactivate, driving abnormal epithelial differentiation and tumorigenesis. These results not only deepen our understanding of early uterine development but also offer a valuable model for studying the progression of reproductive diseases and cancers.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (UCEC) is the most prevalent gynecological malignancy in high-income countries, and its incidence is rising globally. Although early-stage UCEC can be treated with surgery, advanced cases have a poor prognosis, highlighting the need for effective molecular biomarkers to improve diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, we analyzed mRNA and miRNA sequencing data from UCEC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from the TCGA database. Differential expression analysis was conducted using the DESeq2 package, identifying differentially expressed lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs (DElncRNAs, DEmiRNAs, and DEmRNAs). Key molecules were screened using LASSO regression, and a ceRNA network was constructed by predicting lncRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA interaction, which were visualized with Cytoscape. Functional enrichment analysis elucidated the roles and mechanisms of the network. The prognostic potential of the identified RNAs was assessed through survival and Cox regression analyses, while methylation and immune infiltration analyses explored regulatory mechanisms and immune interactions. We identified a prognostic lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network in UCEC, centered on the CDKN2B-AS1-hsa-miR-497-5p-IGF2BP3 axis. Survival analyses confirmed the prognostic significance of this network, with univariate Cox regression demonstrating a strong association between its aberrant expression and overall prognosis in UCEC. However, multivariate Cox regression suggested that other clinical factors may modulate this relationship. Methylation analysis revealed low methylation levels of IGF2BP3, possibly contributing to its overexpression. Furthermore, immune infiltration studies highlighted significant correlations between CDKN2B-AS1, IGF2BP3, and multiple immune cell types, suggesting that this axis regulates the tumor immune microenvironment. These findings suggest that the CDKN2B-AS1-hsa-miR-497-5p-IGF2BP3 axis is a key regulatory element in UCEC and a potential therapeutic target.",

      "abstract": "Lynch syndrome is the most common hereditary cancer predisposition, accounting for 1-5% of colorectal cancer cases, and is driven by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes. Despite established diagnostic criteria, such as the Amsterdam guidelines, Lynch syndrome remains largely underdiagnosed. To address this gap, universal tumour screening has been introduced for all newly diagnosed cases of colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer, significantly improving early detection. The surgical management of colorectal cancer in patients with Lynch syndrome remains controversial. While extended colectomy reduces the risk of metachronous colorectal cancer, surgical strategies must be carefully individualised based on patient-specific factors. Chemoprevention with aspirin has shown promise in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer, with ongoing trials investigating optimal dosing. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, has revolutionised the treatment of Microsatellite Instability-High/deficient Mismatch Repair colorectal cancer, offering durable responses and significant survival benefits. In addition, the neoadjuvant use of immune checkpoint inhibitors is paving the way for non-surgical interventions, potentially transforming the management of colorectal cancer in patients with Lynch syndrome. A multidisciplinary approach and continued research are essential to optimise cancer prevention, treatment and quality of life for people with Lynch syndrome.",

The mortality from EC can largely be attributed to the advanced stage and recurrent cases. Over the past decade, the standard of care for treatment of primary advanced stage and recurrent EC has been chemotherapy, resulting in a median overall survival (OS) of less than 3 years. Advances in molecular tumor profiling have highlighted that a portion of EC tumors release high levels of neoantigens, indicating an opportunity to harness the immune system in therapeutic strategies.

      "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a bone-marrow-based cancer of plasma cells. Over the last 2 decades, marked treatment advances have led to improvements in the overall survival (OS) of patients with this disease. Key developments include the use of chemotherapy, immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies. MM remains incurable, with outcomes influenced by many factors, including age, sex, genetics, and treatment response. This review summarizes recent studies regarding monitoring and treatment of MM, emphasizing the efficacy of new therapies, the impact of maintenance treatments, and approaches for managing relapsed or refractory MM. The role of specific drug classes used to treat MM, including immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and newer treatments such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies and bispecific antibodies are discussed. Combination therapies have significantly improved outcomes. Maintenance therapies, particularly with lenalidomide, have been effective in extending OS but lead to an increased risk of secondary cancers. Venetoclax, selinexor, and ruxolitinib have shown potential as new therapeutic options for patients with relapsed or refractory MM. Immune-based treatments, such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies, mark a major advancement for heavily pretreated patients, although challenges remain related to cost, availability, and side effects. The treatment landscape for patients with MM has seen significant progress, with current therapies providing a longer OS and better quality of life. Future research should focus on optimizing these strategies, personalizing therapies, and exploring new therapeutic targets.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the expression of GPER in EC, assess the impact of estrogen on the proliferation and migration of EC via GPER, and examine the potential role of GPER in mediating the NOTCH pathway to influence EC proliferation and migration. The expression of GPER and its correlation with clinicopathological features were investigated using clinical data. Cell proliferation was assessed through MTT and EdU assays, while cell migration ability was evaluated using wound healing and transwell assays. Western blot analysis was conducted to detect proteins associated with the GPER and NOTCH signaling pathways. Additionally, xenograft tumor models were established to investigate the potential role of estrogen in mediating the NOTCH pathway via GPER. The results demonstrated a significant upregulation of GPER expression in EC, which was associated with clinical stage and metastasis. In vitro experiments provided evidence that estrogen promotes EC cell proliferation and metastasis by enhancing the expression levels of GPER, Notch1, and Hes-1 proteins. Conversely, knocking down or suppressing GPER effectively reverses these effects. Furthermore, treatment with JAG-1, an agonist for the NOTCH pathway, counteracts si-GPER's inhibitory impact on both proliferation and migration abilities of EC cells while increasing Notch1 and Hes-1 protein expression levels; however, it does not alter GPER expression. In vivo experiments have substantiated that estrogen facilitates EC proliferation via the GPER-mediated NOTCH pathway.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial stromal tumors (ESTs) are uncommon mesenchymal tumors of the reproductive system associated with heterogeneous histomolecular features. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), ESTs are classified into benign endometrial stromal nodules (BESN) and endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESSs), which are further divided into low-grade and high-grade subtypes. High-grade ESS is frequently associated with YWHAE-NUTM2 gene fusions, while a newly recognized subtype with BCOR rearrangements, including fusions, alterations, and internal tandem duplications (ITDs), has recently been incorporated into the molecular classification of ESS. BCOR, a transcriptional corepressor of BCL-6, contributes to tumor progression through its role in polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), underscoring its importance in oncogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target. Advances in molecular diagnostics, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), have improved the precision of diagnosing BCOR-altered ESS, enabling better prognostic stratification. These findings also support the development of targeted therapies, including CDK4/6 inhibitors and immunotherapies targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways. Despite these advancements, barriers such as limited access to molecular diagnostics and the high cost of novel therapies remain significant challenges. This review bridges molecular and clinical insights into ESS, emphasizing the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications of BCOR rearrangements. By integrating these advances into clinical practice, it aims to improve outcomes for patients with this rare and aggressive malignancy.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer [EC] is the fourth most common cancer in women in the United States. Stark racial disparities are present in EC outcomes in which Black women have significantly higher EC-related mortality than White women. The social and biologic factors that contribute to these disparities are complex, and may include racial differences in epigenetic landscapes. To investigate race-specific epigenetic differences in EC tumor characteristics and outcomes, we utilized the most recent data within the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Genome-wide CpG methylation data for more than 850 000 CpG sites were analyzed across 245 tumor samples, including 52 from Black women and 181 from White women. Race-adjusted and race-stratified associations among CpG methylation in ECs and molecular subtypes and disease-free survival (DFS) were examined. Race-specific analysis identified subtype-associated CpGs within 9572 genes in tumors from White women, and only 10 genes in tumors that were from Black women. Race-specific analyses also identified survival-associated CpGs with 1119 unique genes identified in tumors from White women, and none identified in tumors from Black women. Genes identified with differential methylation among subtypes included those involved in oxidative stress (HIF3A), and DNA repair (MLH1). Replication cohort data highlighted genes overlapping with those identified within the TCGA, such as G Protein Subunit Beta 1 (GNB1), involved in G-protein signaling, and Interleukin 37 (IL37), involved in cytokine signaling. Identification of these racial differences in EC tumor epigenetic landscapes and associated changes in gene expression may provide insight into strategies to improve outcomes and reduce disparities.",

This study aimed to analyze cancer incidence and mortality data in Fiji from 2010 to 2018 to identify trends and provide an update on the current cancer-related statistics in the Fiji Islands. The top three cancer incidence rates among women were breast, cervical, and endometrial cancer, whereas prostate, liver, and lung cancer were the most prevalent among men. Notably, the central division had higher cancer incidence rates, whereas the northern division had a disproportionately higher mortality rate. Factors contributing to these trends may include lifestyle behaviors, limited access to health care in certain regions, and low awareness. Although this study has limitations due to data quality, it emphasizes the need for targeted interventions, accurate data reporting, and improved cancer treatment delivery to reduce the burden of cancer in Fiji.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer, termed uterine cancer, seriously affects female reproductive organs, and the analysis of histopathological images formed a golden standard for diagnosing this cancer. Sometimes, early detection of this disease is difficult because of the limited capability of modeling complicated relationships among histopathological images and their interpretations. Moreover, many previous methods do not effectively handle the cell appearance variations. Hence, this study develops a novel classification technique called transfer learning convolution neural network with artificial bald eagle optimization (TL-CNN with ABEO) for the classification of uterine tissue. Here, preprocessing is done by the median filter, followed by image enhancement by the multiple identities representation network (MIRNet). Moreover, pelican crow search optimization (PCSO) is used for adapting weights in MIRNet, where PCSO is generated by combining the crow search algorithm (CSA) and pelican optimization algorithm (POA). Then, segmentation quality assessment (SQA) helps in tissue segmentation, and deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) helps in parameter selection that is trained by fractional PCSO (FPCSO). Furthermore, feature extraction is done and, finally, cell classification is done by TL with CNN, which is trained by the proposed ABEO algorithm. Here, ABEO is newly developed by the integration of the bald eagle search (BES) algorithm and artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA). Furthermore, ABEO\u2009+\u2009TL-CNN achieved a high accuracy of 89.59%, a sensitivity of 90.25%, and a specificity of 89.89% by utilizing the cancer image archive dataset.",

      "abstract": "T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is an aggressive lymphoid malignancy with limited treatment options. To discover new treatment targets for T-PLL, we performed high-throughput drug sensitivity screening on 30 primary patient samples ex-vivo. After screening over 2'800 unique compounds, we found T-PLL to be more resistant to most drug classes, including chemotherapeutics, compared to other blood cancers. Furthermore, we discovered previously not reported vulnerabilities of T-PLL. T-PLL cells exhibited a particular sensitivity to drugs targeting autophagy (thapsigargin, bafilomycin A1), nuclear export (selinexor), and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) (birinapant), sensitivities that were also shared by other T-cell malignancies. Through bulk and single-cell RNA-Sequencing we found these compounds to activate the toll-like-receptor (TLR) (bafilomycin A1), p53 (selinexor), and TNF-\u0251/NF\u03baB signaling pathways (birinapant) in T-PLL cells. Focussing on birinapant for its potential in drug repurposing, we uncovered that IAP inhibitor-induced cell death was primarily necroptotic and dependent on TNF-\u0251. Through spectral flow cytometry we confirmed the absence of cleaved caspase-3 in IAP inhibitor treated T-PLL cells and show that IAP inhibition reduces the proliferation of T-PLL cells stimulated ex-vivo, while showing only a limited effect on non-malignant T-cells. In summary, our study maps the drug sensitivity of T-PLL across a broad range of targets and identifies new therapeutic approaches for T-PLL by targeting IAPs, XPO1 and autophagy, highlighting potential candidates for drug repurposing and novel treatment strategies.",

We evaluated patients who were operated between 2010 and 2020 in the obstetrics and gynecology clinic of our center due to EEC. In total, 194 women were determined to be in either the hCG-negative group (n=137) or the hCG-positive group (n=57). The detection rate of deep myometrial invasion (16.8% vs. 36.8%; P=0.002), lymphovascular space invasion (10.9% vs. 24.6%; P=0.015), and metastatic lymph node (6.7% vs. 21.8%; P= 0.003) in patients with hCG-positive staining were analyzed to be significantly higher. Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) (P= 0.015) and overall survival (OS) (P= 0.024) rates were found to be higher in the hCG-negative group. hCG expression was found to be an independent risk factor for recurrence, and DFS in grade I-II EEC was limited to the uterus and with superficial myometrial invasion (low risk). No independent risk factors for OS were analyzed. hCG positivity is a risk factor with poor prognostic factors in endometrial cancer. It was concluded that hCG expression in low-risk EEC is a valuable negative prognostic factor for recurrence and DFS.",

This is especially pertinent in oncology, where high proportions of patients, such as those with melanoma, lung cancer, and endometrial cancer, exhibit usual life spans post-cancer detection. A Bayesian clinical trial design methodology for multivariate time-to-event outcomes with cured fractions is developed. This approach employs a copula to jointly model the multivariate time-to-event outcomes. We propose a model that uses a Gaussian copula on the population survival function, irrespective of cure status. The minimum sample size required to achieve high statistical power while maintaining reasonable control over the type I error rate from a Bayesian perspective is identified using point-mass sampling priors. The methodology is demonstrated in simulation studies inspired by an endometrial cancer trial.",

      "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia and is predominantly affecting the elderly. It is a heterogenous disease, showing a broad spectrum of genomic alterations and mutations that influence the clinical outcome and treatment options. The expression of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is often dysregulated in AML and its constitutive activation is associated with poor outcome. Thus, STAT3 became an attractive therapeutic target but until now drugs targeting STAT3 only had moderate efficacy. This phenomenon might be related to the expression ratio of the two alternatively spliced isoforms: the full-length isoform STAT3\u03b1 and the truncated version STAT3\u03b2, which play opposite roles in AML. In this study, we investigated the potential of selected, well-established drugs to impact the STAT3\u03b2/\u03b1 ratio, as a higher STAT3\u03b2/\u03b1 ratio is associated with better disease outcome. Atovaquone and selinexor independently elevated the STAT3\u03b2/\u03b1 ratio and led to an upregulation of the STAT3\u03b2 target gene SELL (CD62L). The combined treatment with atovaquone and selinexor entailed synergistic killing of AML cells in vitro and impaired the leukemic cell infiltration in vivo. Moreover, CD62L overexpression in a human AML cell line resulted in significantly prolonged survival in a xenograft mouse model. We propose that targeting the STAT3\u03b2/\u03b1 ratio could be a promising new strategy for treating patients with AML and that the combination of selinexor and atovaquone could offer enhanced treatment outcomes.",

This study aimed to develop a novel hybrid radiomics approach integrating multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), deep learning, and multichannel image analysis for predicting MSI and Ki-67 status. A retrospective study included 156 EC patients who were subsequently categorized into MSI and Ki-67 groups. The hybrid radiomics model (HMRadSum) was developed by extracting quantitative imaging features and deep learning features from multiparametric MRI using emerging attention mechanism. Tumor markers were subsequently predicted utilizing an XGBoost classifier. Model performance and interpretability were evaluated using standard classification metrics, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) techniques. For the MSI prediction task, the HMRadSum model achieved area-under-curve (AUC) value of 0.945 (95% CI 0.862-1.000) and accuracy of 0.889. For the Ki-67 prediction task, the AUC and accuracy of HMRadSum model was 0.888 (95% CI 0.743-1.000) and 0.810. This hybrid radiomics model effectively extracted features associated with EC gene expression, providing potential clinical implications for personalized diagnosis, treatment, and treatment strategy optimization.",

      "abstract": "Netrin-1 (NTN1) is a laminin-related secreted protein involved in axon guidance and cell migration. Previous research has established a significant connection between NTN1 and nervous system development. In recent years, mounting evidence indicates that NTN1 also plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. For instance, inhibiting Netrin-1 has been shown to suppress tumor growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics in endometrial cancer. To further elucidate the influence of genes on tumors, we utilized a variety of machine learning techniques and found that NTN1 is strongly linked to multiple cancer types, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target. This study aimed to elucidate the role of NTN1 in pan-cancer using multi-omics data and explore its potential as a prognostic biomarker in SKCM. Analysis of the TCGA, GTEx, and UALCAN databases revealed significant differences in NTN1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Prognostic value was evaluated through univariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods. Mutation and methylation analyses were conducted using the cBioPortal and SMART databases. We identified genes interacting with and correlated to NTN1 through STRING and GEPIA2, respectively. Subsequently, we performed GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. The results suggested that NTN1 might be involved in crucial biological processes and pathways related to cancer development and progression, including cell adhesion, axon guidance, immune response, and various signaling pathways. We then explored the correlation between NTN1 and immune infiltration as well as immunotherapy using the ESTIMATE package, TIMER2.0, TISIDB, TIDE, TIMSO, and TCIA. The relationship between NTN1 and tumor heterogeneity, stemness, DNA methyltransferases, and MMR genes was also examined. Lastly, we constructed a nomogram based on NTN1 in SKCM and investigated its association with drug sensitivity. NTN1 expression was significantly associated with tumor immune infiltration, molecular subtypes, and clinicopathological features in various cancers. Genetic analysis revealed that Deep deletions were the most common type of NTN1 alteration. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between NTN1 CNAs and its expression levels. In most cancers, NTN1 showed positive correlations with immune and stromal scores, as well as with specific immune cell populations. Its predictive value for immunotherapy response was comparable to that of tumor mutational burden. Furthermore, NTN1 exhibited positive correlations with tumor heterogeneity, stemness, DNA methyltransferase genes, and MMR genes. In SKCM, NTN1 was identified as an independent risk factor and demonstrated potential associations with multiple drugs. NTN1 exhibits substantial clinical utility as a prognostic marker and indicator of immune response across various tumor types. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into its potential implications in pan-cancer research.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC), a prevalent gynecological malignancy, presents significant challenges due to its genetic complexity and heterogeneity. The genomic landscape of EC is underpinned by genetic alterations, such as mutations in PTEN, PIK3CA, and ARID1A, and chromosomal abnormalities. The identification of molecular subtypes-POLE ultramutated, microsatellite instability (MSI), copy number low, and copy number high-illustrates the diverse genetic profiles within EC and underscores the need for subtype-specific therapeutic strategies. The integration of multi-omics technologies such as single-cell genomics and spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized our understanding and approach to studying EC and offers a holistic perspective that enhances the ability to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The translation of these multi-omics findings into personalized medicine and precision oncology is increasingly feasible in clinical practice. Targeted therapies such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors have demonstrated the potential for improved treatment efficacy tailored to specific genetic alterations. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in terms of variability in patient responses, the integration of genomic data into clinical workflows, and ethical considerations. This review explores the genomic underpinnings of EC, from genes to clinical practice. It highlights the ongoing need for multidisciplinary research and collaboration to address the complexities of EC and improve diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes.",

Elevated PD-L1 expression (CPS\u2009\u2265\u20091) is often used as a prognostic marker as well as a predictive biomarker of response to ICi in different tumor types. In a retrospective, patient derived study, we analyzed PD1- and PD-L1 staining and correlated the results of different scores to clinical data to evaluate the prognostic impact of these scores.",

      "abstract": "Early pregnancy care involves the screening and identification of women with risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth or preterm birth, to tailor pregnancy care and interventions accordingly. Most stillbirths and approximately two-thirds of preterm births, however, occur in the absence of evident risk factors. The majority of stillbirths occur in the preterm period, yet there are few interventions targeting this period, and progress to reduce stillbirth rates remains slow. Placental dysfunction is a major contributor to stillbirth, particularly, preterm stillbirth. Here, the endometrial environment may shed light on factors that influence placental development and the trajectory of a pregnancy. Menstrual symptoms or abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) can indicate endometrial disorders, which are associated with infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Whether AUB is associated with pregnancy outcomes in the absence of a diagnosed endometrial pathology, however, remains unknown. Limited information regarding a woman's menstrual cycle is captured in routine early pregnancy assessments, such as the last menstrual period and menstrual cycle length. Given the latent diagnosis of endometrial disorders and that up to a third of all women experience AUB during their lifetime, determining the association between menstrual characteristics and pregnancy outcomes has the potential to uncover new clinical strategies to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, this study aims to understand the association between menstruation and pregnancy outcomes to identify which menstrual characteristics could provide value as a pregnancy risk assessment tool.",

      "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulatory molecules in cancer biology. Among these, long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 02418 (LINC02418), a recently identified lncRNA, has been linked to endometrial cancer (EC), although its function and operational mechanisms are largely unclear. The present investigation aims to elucidate the molecular mechanism through which LINC02418 influences EC pathogenesis. We employed Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR to analyze Ras protein specific guanine nucleotide releasing factor 1 (RASGRF1) and LINC02418 expression profiles in EC tissues and cell lines. Functional analyses, including cell proliferation, migration, and invasion assays, were conducted to evaluate the impact of LINC02418 overexpression on EC cells. Xenograft mouse models were established for in vivo validation. The molecular interactions between LINC02418, miR-494-3p, and RASGRF1 were characterized using luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. LINC02418 expression was significantly downregulated in EC tissues and cell lines compared to their normal counterparts. Forced expression of LINC02418 significantly suppressed EC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. In xenograft models, LINC02418 overexpression resulted in reduced tumor burden and enhanced cell death. Mechanistically, LINC02418 enhanced RASGRF1 expression by sequestering miR-494-3p, a finding substantiated by RNA pull-down assays. The tumor-suppressive effects of LINC02418 were partially reversed by RASGRF1 silencing and miR-494-3p overexpression. Clinical analyses revealed that reduced RASGRF1 expression correlated with poor histological differentiation, advanced tumor stages, and decreased overall survival in EC patients. Our findings establish LINC02418 as a tumor suppressor that regulates EC progression through modulation of the miR-494-3p/RASGRF1 axis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in EC treatment.",

Anti-contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) antibodies can cause PLE in patients with particular tumors, which in most cases can be identified as thymoma, lung cancer, or endometrial cancer. Some case reports show rare instances with other tumors, such as throat or sigmoid carcinoma.

Although the site of recurrence is mostly the endometrium, we here report a case of metastatic recurrence to the para-aortic lymph node with endometrial recurrence despite a careful follow-up. A 31-year-old woman was diagnosed with grade 1 endometrioid carcinoma, stage IA without myometrial invasion. She requested fertility-sparing treatment and underwent a 48-week MPA therapy with complete remission. Follow-up continued with ultrasonography and endometrial biopsy every 3 and 6\u2009months, respectively; however, at 10\u2009months following MPA therapy, cancer recurrence was detected in the endometrium and para-aortic lymph node, requiring hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, and lymph node dissection, followed by paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy. This case report highlights that lymph node recurrence can develop despite careful follow-up following complete remission with MPA therapy for stage IA endometrial cancer.",

A Markov model based on DUO-E Phase III trial data simulated disease progression and outcomes. Total costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were evaluated. Sensitivity analysis assessed model robustness. For dMMR EC, costs (QALYs) were $1,204,763.33 (5.49), $590,732.13 (4.61), and $1,495,528.15 (3.68) for DOCT, DCT, and CT, respectively, with ICER of $584,140.94/QALYs (DOCT vs. CT) and $476,946.43/QALYs (DCT vs. CT).

      "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the causal relationship between lipidome and female reproductive diseases (FRDs) using an advanced series of Mendelian randomization (MR) methods. This study utilized genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics encompassing 179 lipidomes and six prevalent FRDs, namely polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, uterine fibroid, female infertility, uterine endometrial cancer, and ovarian cancer. The two-sample MR (TSMR) approach was employed to investigate the causal relationships, with further validation using false discovery rate (FDR) and multivariable MR (MVMR) methods. Subsequently, a range of comprehensive evaluations were performed, including sensitivity analysis, mediation MR analysis, reverse MR analysis, and steiger test. Examining 179 lipidome traits as exposures and 6 FRDs as outcomes, this study identified significant causal effects of 56 lipids on FRDs. Following multiple testing correction and MVMR validation, sphingomyelin (d38:2) was found to have a protective effect against PCOS (\u03b2 = -0.104, 95% CI: -0.199 ~ -0.010, P\u2009=\u20090.031). Phosphatidylcholine (18:0_22:6) was associated with a decreased risk of developing uterine fibroid (\u03b2 = -0.111, 95% CI: -0.201~ -0.021, P\u2009=\u20090.016), and sterol ester (27:1/20:3) showed significance in uterine endometrial cancer (\u03b2 = -0.248, 95% CI: -0.443 ~ -0.053, P\u2009=\u20090.013). Conversely, phosphatidylethanolamine (18:2_0:0) was associated with increased risk of endometriosis (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.183, 95% CI: 0.015\u2009~\u20090.350, P\u2009=\u20090.033), while sterol ester (27:1/18:1) posed a risk influence on uterine fibroid (\u03b2\u2009=\u20091.007, 95% CI: 0.925\u2009~\u20091.089, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and phosphatidylcholine (16:0_22:6) on uterine endometrial cancer (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.229, 95% CI: 0.039\u2009~\u20090.420, P\u2009=\u20090.018). Furthermore, it was determined that the causal associations between these lipidome profiles and FRDs were independent of BMI, obesity, diabetes, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, inflammation, depression, waist-hip ratio, vitamin D, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, sex hormone binding globulin, and testosterone levels. Most outcomes passed consistent tests without evidence of heterogeneity, pleiotropy, or reverse causality. The results indicated a close association between specific lipidomes, particularly sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, cholesterol ester, and phosphatidylcholines, with FRDs. These lipid species may potentially serve as biomarkers and future drug targets for the treatment of FRDs.",

A prognostic model for UCEC was developed using LASSO Cox regression analysis and a Nomogram, integrating survival data, status, and gene signatures. TIMER analysis assessed the impact of crucial cuproptosis-related genes on immune cell infiltration in UCEC. Validation of the selected genes, CDKN2A, GLS, and PPAT, was performed at both mRNA and protein levels. A total of 27 cuproptosis-related genes were identified, with 19 upregulated and 6 downregulated in UCEC. These genes were associated with key signaling pathways, including the TCA cycle, Pyruvate metabolism, Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis, and Platinum drug resistance. The LASSO regression and Nomogram models demonstrated robust predictive performance for UCEC prognosis, identifying CDKN2A, GLS, and PPAT as critical prognostic genes. Furthermore, these genes played essential roles in immune cell infiltration in UCEC, confirming their significance. Validation at both mRNA and protein levels solidified the role of CDKN2A, GLS, and PPAT. The identified signature of CDKN2A, GLS, and PPAT demonstrates significant predictive value for UCEC prognosis, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets, including their application in immunotherapy strategies.",

      "abstract": "Cancer cells in the right subdiaphragmatic lavage may reflect peritoneal dissemination, but its prognostic significance is unknown. This study investigated recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and recurrence patterns in patients with curatively resected endometrial cancer by cytology collection site. Peritoneal cytology was collected at the beginning of surgery by washing the pelvic and right subdiaphragmatic cavity separately. The analysis included 465 patients with the median follow-up duration of 121 months. Of these, 62 (13%) patients had positive pelvic cytology and 22 (5%) patients had positive right subdiaphragmatic cytology. Patients positive for right subdiaphragmatic cytology were all positive for pelvic cytology, showing the worst RFS and OS among the study population. Multivariate analyses showed positive right subdiaphragmatic cytology, not pelvic cytology, significantly correlated with shorter RFS and OS when adjusted for clinicopathological factors. Patients with both pelvic and right subdiaphragmatic positive cytology had significantly higher peritoneal recurrence rates than those negative at both sites. However, patients with only positive pelvic cytology showed no significant difference in the recurrence rate. Our results suggest that the prognostic significance of peritoneal cytology may differ depending on the collection site in endometrial cancer and provide new insights to select patients for adjuvant therapy.",

      "abstract": "Gynecologic cancers (GCs), including cervical cancer (CC), ovarian cancer (OC), endometrial cancer (EC), as well as vulvar and vaginal cancers, represent major health threats to women, with increasing incidence rates observed globally. Conventional treatments, such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, are often hindered by challenges such as drug resistance and recurrence, contributing to high mortality rates. Organoid technology has emerged as a transformative tool in cancer research, offering in vitro models that closely replicate the tumor cell architecture and heterogeneity of primary cancers. Tumor-derived organoids preserve the histological and molecular characteristics of the original tumors, making them invaluable for studying tumor biology, molecular pathways, and the tumor immune microenvironment. Furthermore, organoids play a crucial role in biomarker discovery, drug screening, and the development of personalized therapeutic strategies. In contrast to traditional cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, gynecologic cancer organoids accurately mirror the genetic mutations and specific gene expression profiles of primary tumors. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in the development of gynecologic cancer organoid models, highlighting their contributions to understanding disease mechanisms, facilitating drug discovery, and advancing precision medicine. It also addresses the potential and challenges of organoid technology, with a focus on its role in advancing personalized treatment approaches for GCs.",

The KEYNOTE-775 trial for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer demonstrated the benefits of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination therapy, and the results of this trial led to the approval of its coverage for recurrent cancer by the Japanese health insurance system. Currently, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors is transitioning from second-line to first-line therapy. In a global randomized phase III study, the drugs dostarlimab, durvalumab, and atezolizumab, which are not yet approved in Japan, showed better results in the study arms than in the control arm. Additionally, biomarkers have been developed for endometrial cancer, enabling gynecologists to pursue treatment options based on the biomarkers detected for better treatment outcomes.

Our study sought to elucidate the causal association between CRP and EC, aiming to contribute to the understanding of this complex interplay. We primarily utilized the random-effects inverse variance-weighted method. This approach served as the foundation for our analysis, complemented by 3 additional techniques, including Mendelian randomization-Egger, weighted-median, and weighted mode. A series of sensitivity analyses were also conducted to affirm the stability and reliability of our results. Employing the inverse variance-weighted method, our findings indicated that a one-unit increment in log-transformed CRP concentrations (mg/L) was associated with a relatively 9.7% increased risk of overall EC (odds ratio [OR]\u2005=\u20051.097, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.996-1.208, P\u2005=\u2005.061), an 11% higher risk of endometrioid endometrial cancer (OR\u2005=\u20051.110, 95% CI: 1.000-1.231, P\u2005=\u2005.049) and a 25% increased risk of non-endometrioid cancers (OR\u2005=\u20051.250, 95% CI: 1.005-1.555, P\u2005=\u2005.045). Sensitivity analyses did not reveal evidence of horizontal pleiotropy in the analysis of CRP and overall EC, endometrioid endometrial cancer, or non-endometrioid cancers (P\u2005>\u2005.05). In the reverse analysis, our data demonstrated that EC exert no reverse effect on CRP levels. Our study suggested causal relationships between CRP and an elevated risk of EC and its subtypes, which contribute to the ongoing discourse on the role of inflammation, as indicated by CRP levels, in the etiology of EC and its variants.",

      "abstract": "Advances in gynaecologic oncology research lead to continuous updates in clinical guidelines. However, undergraduate medical education often lacks in-depth coverage of recent developments, limiting students' preparedness for evidence-based management of gynaecological cancers. This study aimed to bridge the educational gap by integrating case-based analyses of practice-changing studies into the undergraduate obstetrics and gynaecology course. We aimed to enhance students' understanding of relevant gynaecologic oncology concepts and improve their skills in analysing scientific literature related to cancer management. An educational method was introduced to 5th-year medical students (n\u2009=\u200946) over a 2-week course. Using clinical case scenarios, students were presented with examples of practice-changing trials along with research findings incorporated into clinical practice. Following the course, 36 students completed a feedback survey evaluating their knowledge and research interpretation skills before and after the course. Descriptive statistical methods and Fisher's exact test were used to assess students' self-reported knowledge improvement. There were significant increases in students' self-reported knowledge level on the covered topics, including a distinction between chemotherapy types (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), surgical treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), maintenance therapy in ovarian cancer (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), molecular classification (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and immunotherapy in endometrial cancer (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Understanding of inclusion criteria and endpoints in scientific articles also improved, rising from 22 to 86% (p\u2009<\u20090.0001, OR 21, 95% CI 5.62-78.48). Incorporating practice-changing studies into clinical teaching significantly enhances students' perceived comprehension of gynaecologic oncology and strengthens their self-reported research interpretation skills. This methodological approach highlights the value of connecting case-based learning with current research.",

      "abstract": "Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent benign disease characterized by growth of the endometrial tissue outside the uterine wall. Several reports suggest the possibility of the pathogenesis and recurrence of endometriosis being related to functions of stem/progenitor cells of the endometrium. The drawback of the widely used method of using Hoechst 33342, a fluorescent dye, to collect stem cell-like populations, is the requirement of an ultraviolet (UV) excitation source not commonly provided on standard flow cytometers. Here, we aimed to overcome this hurdle by establishing a novel method that uses DyeCycle Green (DCG), a cell-permeable DNA dye, for collecting a significantly higher fraction of stem cell-like side population (SP) from HHUA cells (human endometrial cancer cell line) with standard equipment without a UV laser. Furthermore, subculturing the DCG-SP cells expanded their population remarkably. The DCG-SP cells possessed stem cell-like characteristics with high expression of stem cell markers such as aldehyde dehydrogenase 1\u202fA (ALDH1A), sushi domain containing 2 (SUSD2), increased colony formation ability, and high tumorigenicity in vivo, although the expression of some stem cell markers varied during expansion. We screened inhibitors for selective proliferation of the DCG-SP cells over immortalized endometrial cells (EM-E6/E7/hTERT-2 cells) and identified two effective compounds disulfiram and NSC319726. In addition, these compounds inhibited the colony formation and invasiveness of the DCG-SP cells. Our DCG-mediated screening of SP cells would possibly be translational to identify compounds that selectively target stem cells for the treatment and inhibition of recurrence of endometriosis.",

      "title": "Best Practice Recommendations for Endometrial Intraepithelial Neoplasia/Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasia in the Military Health System.",
      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is the most prevalent gynecologic cancer in the United States and has rising incidence and mortality. Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical endometrial hyperplasia (EIN-AEH), a precancerous neoplasm, is surgically managed with hysterectomy in patients who have completed childbearing because of risk of progression to cancer. Concurrent endometrial carcinoma (EC) is also present on hysterectomy specimens in up to 50% of cases. Conservative medical management with progestins and close surveillance can be employed for certain populations after evaluating for concurrent EC. Currently, national professional guidelines recommend an individualized approach based on community access to care and patient factors. There is, however, no US civilian consensus on who should primarily manage EIN-AEH: Physician gynecologic specialists (GSs) and/or gynecologic oncologist (GO) subspecialists. Military health care presents an additional challenge with beneficiaries stationed at remote or overseas locations. While patients may not have local access to a GO subspecialist, many locations are staffed with GSs. Travel for care with a GO incurs additional cost for the patient and the military health care system, removes patients from local support systems, and can impact mission readiness. To provide the best care, optimize clinical outcomes, and avoid over- or under-treatment, military-specific guidelines for EIN-AEH management are needed. We propose a clinical decision tree incorporating both GS and GO subspecialists in the care of military beneficiaries with EIN-AEH. The subject matter expert panel recommends referral of EIN-AEH to a military (preferrable) or civilian GO for management if local access is available within 100\u2009miles[Q1] . If travel of >100\u2009miles is required, the patient should be offered the choice of a military GO referral if available within 250\u2009miles (preferred) versus management by a GS. If travel is >100\u2009miles from a GO or the patient declines a GO referral, the panel recommends that the GS should attempt to exclude concurrent EC by performing a hysteroscopic assessment of the endometrium with a directed biopsy, if not already done. A pelvic ultrasound should be obtained to evaluate the endometrial thickness (>2\u2009cm more likely to harbor EC) along with a secondary gynecologic pathology review with immunohistochemical testing for Lynch syndrome (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) and p53 expression. If any major additional risk factors are uncovered, the patient should be referred to a GO subspecialist for further management. If no additional major risk factors for concurrent EC are identified and hysteroscopy with expert gynecologic pathology review confirms no presence of EC in the pathology specimen, a virtual consultation and counseling with a military GO can be offered, with local surgical and/or medical management provided by a GS. If on subsequent pathology, EC is identified, the patient should be referred to a GO for further treatment considerations and counseling. Determining the optimal treatment for patients with EIN-AEH is nuanced and, within the military health care system, is complicated by varied access to expert management by a GO subspecialist. Military beneficiaries with this diagnosis present a unique challenge and warrant a standardized approach to maximize clinical outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is a common gynaecological malignancy associated with metabolic dysfunctions such as obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, as well as hormonal imbalances, particularly involving oestrogen and progesterone. These factors disrupt normal cellular metabolism, heightening the risk of developing endometrioid EC (EEC), the most prevalent subtype of EC. The insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) pathway, a key regulator of growth, metabolism, and organ function, is implicated in EC progression. Recent research highlights the distinct roles of IGF1 isoforms, including IGF1-Ea, IGF1-Eb, and IGF1-Ec, in promoting tumour growth, metastasis, and hormone signalling interactions, particularly with oestrogen. This review examines the function and clinical significance of IGF-1 isoforms, emphasising their mechanisms in gynaecological physiology and their contributions to EC pathogenesis. Evidence from other cancers further underscores the relevance of IGF1 isoforms in driving tumour behaviours, offering valuable insights into their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Understanding these mechanisms provides opportunities for novel approaches to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of EC, improving patient outcomes and advancing the broader field of hormone-driven cancers.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological neoplasm with an increased incidence in the premenopausal population in recent decades. This raises the problem of managing endometrial cancer in fertile women who have not yet achieved pregnancy. In these women, after careful selection, hysterectomy may be postponed in favor of conservative management if specific requirements are met. The latest evidence is focused on early endometrial carcinoma, endometrioid histotype, Grading 1, with no evidence of myometrial infiltration. Few clinical trials have opened this possibility also for women with an endometrial cancer Grading 2 diagnosis. There are still questions about the best medical therapy, dosage, route, and duration of treatment. Oral progestins or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices appear to be the options associated with the best outcome in terms of complete response and lower recurrence rates. Other options include the use of GnRH analogues, surgical hysteroscopy, or metformin, in a therapeutic approach that takes into account the characteristics of the patient. The pursuit of pregnancy should start as soon as two consecutive endometrial biopsies are obtained 3 months apart from each other; it is recommended to refer the patients to ART centers to maximize the success rate. After having reached the fulfillment of the reproductive desire, surgical radical treatment is still recommended.",

The goal of this review paper is to (i) deliberate on the role of FGFs and FGF receptors (FGFRs) in different cancers, (ii) present advances in FGF-targeted cancer therapies, and (iii) explore cell signaling mechanisms that explain how FGF expression becomes dysregulated during cancer development. FGF is often mutated and overexpressed in cancer and the different FGF and FGFR isoforms have unique expression patterns and distinct roles in different cancers. Among the FGF members, the FGF 15/19 subfamily is particularly interesting because of its unique protein structure and role in endocrine function. The abnormal expression of FGFs in different cancer types (breast, colorectal, hepatobiliary, bronchogenic, and others) is examined and correlated with patient prognosis. The classification of FGF ligands based on their mode of action, whether autocrine, paracrine, endocrine, or intracrine, is illustrated, and an analysis of the binding specificity of FGFs to FGFRs is also provided. Moreover, the latest advances in cancer therapeutic strategies involving small molecules, ligand traps, and monoclonal antibody-based FGF inhibitors are presented. Lastly, we discuss how the dysregulation of FGF and FGFR expression affects FGF signaling and its role in cancer development.",

      "abstract": "Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC) represents a common malignant neoplasm in women, with its prognosis being intricately associated with available therapeutic interventions. In the past few decades, there has been a burgeoning interest in the role of mitochondria within the context of UCEC. Nevertheless, the development and application of prognostic models predicated on mitochondrial-related genes (MRGs) in UCEC remains in the exploratory stages. This study utilized RNA sequencing data and clinical information from the TCGA database to identify differentially expressed MRGs (DEMRGs) between UCEC and normal groups that are associated with overall survival (OS). Patients were randomly assigned to training and testing cohorts in a 1:1 ratio. In the training cohort, a risk model based on DEMRGs was developed using Lasso Cox regression analysis. Subsequently, patients in both cohorts were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on their median risk scores. The prognostic performance of the model was validated through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, ROC curves, and nomograms. Additionally, further analyses including functional enrichment, immune landscape assessment, prediction of response to ICB therapy, mutation profiling, and drug sensitivity analysis elucidated biological distinctions between the identified risk groups. We established a risk model incorporating eight MRGs. Patients classified within he high-risk group exhibited significantly poorer prognoses relative to those in the low-risk group. Functional enrichment analysis identified substantial differences in biological processes and signaling pathways between the high-risk and low-risk cohorts. Immune landscape analysis showed that patients with elevated risk scores exhibited significant immunosuppressive and immune evasion mechanisms. Conversely, low-risk patients exhibited higher expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) family members and immune checkpoint genes (ICGs) compared to their high-risk counterparts.Consequently, low-risk patients showed greater responsiveness to immunotherapy and potential small molecule drugs, whereas high-risk patients were more susceptible to chemotherapy. The mitochondrial-related risk model formulated in this study demonstrates efficacy in predicting both prognosis and response to immunotherapy in patients with UCEC, thereby providing a scientific basis for personalized treatment strategies. Future research endeavors should focus on further validating the clinical utility of this model and investigate the specific mechanisms of the identified MRGs in UCEC.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is a prevalent gynecological malignancy with a rising incidence and poor prognosis in advanced cases. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in various cancers, including EC. This study explores the role of lncRNA Linc01224 in EC. Analyzing TCGA data, we found Linc01224 expression significantly elevated in EC tissues, correlating with poor prognosis. Clinical samples validated these findings, showing higher Linc01224 levels in tumor tissues. Knockdown of Linc01224 in EC cell lines (Hec-1-B and Ishikawa) inhibited proliferation, migration, and promoted apoptosis, alongside increased Bax and decreased BCL2 expression. Furthermore, Linc01224 knockdown notably reduced Wnt2/\u03b2-catenin pathway activation. We identified TPX2 as a target of miR-4673, which is regulated by Linc01224 through a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism. Dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed miR-4673 binding to Linc01224 and TPX2. Rescue experiments revealed that TPX2 knockdown reversed Linc01224-induced proliferation and migration, highlighting TPX2's pivotal role in Linc01224's oncogenic function. In vivo, Linc01224 knockdown significantly impeded tumor growth and metastasis in a xenograft model, with decreased expression of c-Myc, Cyclin D1, and \u03b2-catenin. These findings reveal a novel ceRNA regulatory axis involving Linc01224, miR-4673, and TPX2, elucidating Linc01224's role in EC progression through the Wnt2/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Linc01224 emerges as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for EC prognosis and treatment.",

This study investigated the inhibitory effects of Bofutrelvir, Nirmatrelvir, and Selinexor on 3CLpro through molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and free energy calculations. Nirmatrelvir exhibited the strongest binding affinity across docking tools (AutoDock Vina: -8.3 kcal/mol; DiffDock: -7.75 kcal/mol; DynamicBound: 7.59 to 7.89 kcal/mol), outperforming Selinexor and Bofutrelvir. Triplicate 300 ns MD simulations revealed that the Nirmatrelvir-3CLpro complex displayed high conformational stability, reduced root mean square deviation (RMSD), and a modest decrease in solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), indicating enhanced structural rigidity. Gibbs free energy analysis highlighted greater flexibility in unbound 3CLpro, stabilized by Nirmatrelvir binding, supported by stable hydrogen bonds. MolProphet prediction tools, targeting the Cys145 residue, confirmed that Nirmatrelvir exhibited the strongest binding, forming multiple hydrophobic, hydrogen, and \u03c0-stacking interactions with key residues, and had the lowest predicted IC",

      "abstract": "The most common histological subtypes of endometrial cancer consist of endometrioid and uterine serous carcinoma, with the latter being more aggressive and accompanied by poor prognosis. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. HER2 positivity can be diagnosed in many solid tumors. It has been found that approximately one-third of the patients diagnosed with serous carcinoma may overexpress HER2/neu protein and/or show the amplification of the c-erBb2 gene. The prognostic and predictive value of HER2 biomarker is nowadays highlighted and the updates of HER2-directed treatment offer new opportunities for improved efficacy and survival. A number of HER2-targeted therapies have become available in recent years and have had promising results, prompting full drug approvals and additional investigation in many cancer types, among which is endometrial cancer. Data from clinical trials combining classical chemotherapy with anti-HER2 agents, mainly trastuzumab, alone or in combination with pertuzumab, do exist and have been incorporated into international guidelines. Moreover, further research with antibody-drug conjugates and tyrosine kinase inhibitors is being conducted. Acquired resistance remains an important problem, and its underlying mechanisms in endometrial cancer are mostly unknown. Studies exploring earlier use of Her2-directed therapy are also on the way. The purpose of this literature review is to describe the available therapies in the current clinical practice and the most prominent research data regarding the future. In any case, a number of unmet medical needs do exist for HER2-positive serous endometrial cancer, and additional research and studies are warranted to provide further understanding and improved outcomes for this tumor type.",

      "abstract": "This review evaluates the advances in the early detection and diagnosis of endometrial cancer (EC), emphasizing the growing importance of minimally invasive techniques and novel biomarkers. Current diagnostic protocols for EC rely heavily on invasive procedures such as transvaginal ultrasound (TVU), hysteroscopy, and endometrial biopsy, which, although effective, can be overly burdensome for patients and inefficient for asymptomatic or low-risk populations. As there is no consensus on EC screening in high-risk or general populations, recent studies have explored alternative methods using biofluids and genomic biomarkers to improve sensitivity and specificity and facilitate access for patients. This review summarizes findings on DNA methylation markers, circulating tumor-derived nucleic acids, and the potential of liquid biopsy approaches for the early detection of EC. These innovations may not only streamline screening but also reduce the need for invasive procedures. This review highlights the potential of these biomarkers to be integrated seamlessly into the existing cervical cancer screening programs, which could transform screening methods for endometrial cancer and support the development of personalized, less invasive diagnostic procedures.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is a common gynecological malignancy for which polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has been identified as a significant risk factor. Quercetin, a widely distributed natural flavonoid, has demonstrated potential therapeutic effects in managing both PCOS and EC. However, the specific molecular targets of quercetin in the context of PCOS comorbid with EC (PCOS-EC) remain poorly defined. This study aims to elucidate the therapeutic potential of quercetin for treating PCOS-EC using network pharmacology, molecular dynamics simulations, and in vitro assays. The intersection of 379 PCOS-EC-associated targets with 361 quercetin targets identified 47 potential therapeutic targets of quercetin for PCOS-EC. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed the biological functions, while Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes identified the pathways potentially involved in quercetin's effects against PCOS-EC. Protein-protein interaction network analysis highlighted six overlapping targets, namely, ACTB, AKT1, EGFR, ESR1, PTGS2, and TP53. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that quercetin bound with high affinity to the hub genes, with AKT1 emerging as a central target. In vitro experiments confirmed that quercetin treatment significantly downregulated AKT expression in EC cells. These findings elucidate potential targets and molecular mechanisms through which quercetin exerts its therapeutic effects.",

      "abstract": "This study systematically explores the oncogenic role of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00115 in endometrial cancer (EC) and reveals its unique mechanism in promoting proliferation, invasion, and metastasis via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. LINC00115 is significantly upregulated in EC tissues and closely associated with advanced TNM staging and lymph node metastasis. Functional assays showed that knockdown of LINC00115 suppressed EC cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, while overexpression enhanced these malignant behaviors. In vivo models confirmed that LINC00115 overexpression accelerates tumor growth and metastasis. Our study is the first to identify LINC00115 as a key activator of the JAK/STAT pathway through direct interaction with KH-type Splicing Regulatory Protein (KHSRP), a previously unrecognized mechanism in EC. This finding provides new insights into lncRNA-mediated signaling regulation and highlights LINC00115 as a novel biomarker and promising therapeutic target for EC, offering a theoretical basis for developing targeted therapies.",

      "abstract": "In most cancers, including endometrial cancer, tumor suppressor genes harboring inactivating mutations have been systematically cataloged. However, locus-specific epigenetic alterations contributing to cancer initiation and progression remain only partly described, creating knowledge gaps about functionally significant tumor suppressors and underlying mechanisms associated with their inactivation. Here, we show that PAX2 is an endometrial tumor suppressor recurrently inactivated by a distinct epigenetic reprogramming event not associated with promoter hypermethylation. PAX2 is expressed throughout normal endometrial glands; however, microscopic clones with PAX2 protein loss arise spontaneously in adulthood and progress to endometrial precancers and cancers. Here we show that PAX2 protein loss occurs via transcriptional silencing in 80% of endometrial cancers. Mechanistically, transcriptomic, epigenomic, 3D genomic, and machine learning analyses showed that silencing is associated with replacement of open/active chromatin features (H3K27ac/H3K4me3) with inaccessible/repressive features (H3K27me3). The spread of the H3K27me3 signal is restrained by cohesin loops, preventing transcriptional dysregulation of neighboring genes. Functionally, PAX2 loss promoted endometrial carcinogenesis by rewiring the transcriptional landscape via global enhancer reprogramming.

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is a worldwide gynecologic malignancies, with a remarking increase of incidence and mortality rates in recent years. Growing evidence indicates that glucose metabolism reprogramming is the most representative metabolic signature of tumor cells and exploring its modulatory function in EC development will promote identifying potential EC therapeutic targets. IGFBP2 is an insulin-like growth factor binding protein which is closely associated with a variety of metabolic diseases. However, its biological role in EC and its effects on glucose metabolism remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that IGFBP2 was highly expressed in EC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of IGFBP2 promoted proliferation and glycolysis in EC cells, whereas IGFBP2 knockdown had the opposite effect. Mechanistically, IGFBP2 directly interacted with PKM2, inducing weakened PKM2 protein degradation, and knockdown IGFBP2 expression prevented the translocation of PKM2 to the nucleus. Additionally, IGFBP2 expression was upregulated under the condition of hypoxia which directly regulated by transcriptional activation of HIF-1\u03b1. Finally, the role of the IGFBP2/PKM2/HIF-1\u03b1 axis in EC tumor growth was confirmed in\u00a0vivo using mouse xenograft models. Taken together, the current study identifies IGFBP2 as an upstream activator of PKM2-driven proliferation and glycolysis in EC cells, providing a promising therapeutic target for EC.",

      "abstract": "An optical biosensor is a specialized analytical device that utilizes the principles of optics and light in bimolecular processes. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is a phenomenon in the realm of nanophotonics that occurs when metallic nanoparticles (NPs) or nanostructures interact with incident light. Conversely, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is an influential analytical technique based on Raman scattering, wherein it amplifies the Raman signals of molecules when they are situated near specific and specially designed nanostructures. A detailed exploration of the recent ground-breaking developments in optical biosensors employing LSPR and SERS technologies has been thoroughly discussed along with their underlying principles and the working mechanisms. A biosensor chip has been created, featuring a high-density deposition of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) under varying ligand concentration and reaction duration on the substrate. An ordinary description, along with a visual illustration, has been thoroughly provided for concepts such as a sensogram, refractive index shift, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and the evanescent field, Rayleigh scattering, Raman scattering, as well as the electromagnetic enhancement and chemical enhancement. LSPR and SERS both have advantages and disadvantages, but widely used SERS has some advantages over LSPR, like chemical specificity, high sensitivity, multiplexing, and versatility in different fields. This review confirms and elucidates the significance of different disease biomarker identification. LSPR and SERS both play a vital role in the detection of various types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and brain tumors. This proposed optical biosensor offers potential applications for early diagnosis and monitoring of viral disease, bacterial infectious diseases, fungal diseases, diabetes, and cardiac disease biosensing. LSPR and SERS provide a new direction for environmental monitoring, food safety, refining impurities from water samples, and lead detection. The understanding of these biosensors is still limited and challenging.",

Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were evaluated using CCK8, colony formation, flow cytometry, and transwell assays. A western blot was used to analyze the expression of markers affiliated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process and AKT/mTOR pathway. As a result, MFAP5 was found to be down-regulated in EC. Overexpression of MFAP5 suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis of HEC-1-A and Ishikawa cells, as evidenced by the inhibition of cell viability and colony formation, and the increase in cell apoptosis rate. Besides, overexpression of MFAP5 attenuated the abilities of cell migration and invasion, as well as reduced MMP2 and MMP9 protein expression. Furthermore, E-cadherin protein level was elevated, while N-cadherin and \u03b1-SMA protein levels were decreased, and the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR was reduced in cells overexpressing MFAP5. Our findings indicate that MFAP5 overexpression inhibits the malignant behaviors of EC cells, possibly by blocking the AKT/mTOR pathway, suggesting that MFAP5 may be a new therapeutic target for EC.",

However, the safety and efficacy of conversion surgery with low anterior rectal resection for unresectable EC following LP therapy is unknown. A 37-year-old woman was referred with unresectable EC with pleural fluid, peritoneal dissemination, and ascites. After the failure of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, she was administered LP as second-line treatment. After 10 treatment cycles, uterine and peritoneal tumors significantly reduced in size, except the left ovarian metastatic tumor which became slightly larger. Cytoreductive surgery, including low anterior resection of the rectum and colorectal anastomosis, achieved complete resection. However, on postoperative day 11, the patient experienced an anastomotic leakage around the colorectal anastomosis site, necessitating a double-barreled colostomy and percutaneous drainage. She was discharged 15\u00a0days after the second surgery and resumed LP therapy after 44\u00a0days following the second surgery. We report a case in which conversion surgery after LP therapy was conducted for unresectable advanced endometrial cancer. Our findings indicate that if bowel resection is required, a longer preoperative withdrawal period may be necessary to prevent postoperative anastomotic leakage.",

Maackiain (MA), a natural flavonoid compound, has multiple biological activities, but little is known about how it affects EC cells. In the present study, CCK-8, EdU, colony formation, and flow cytometry assays were used to evaluate the effects of MA on EC cell proliferation, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The effect of MA on autophagy in EC cells were examined through the observation of cell morphology and ultrastructure, and cells were transfected with AdPlus-mCherry-GFP-LC3B for further analysis. Transcriptomic and western blot analyses revealed the underlying mechanism. To evaluate the anti-EC effect of MA in vivo, a xenograft model was established. The results demonstrated that MA inhibited KLE and Ishikawa cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, MA significantly suppressed EC xenograft tumor growth in vivo while exhibiting low toxicity. In addition, EC cells treated with MA exhibited pro-apoptotic and pro-autophagic responses, with the latter exhibiting cytoprotective properties. MA also induced the accumulation of ROS, which promoted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Notably, the use of the N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) ROS scavenger and the 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) ER stress inhibitor effectively mitigated the autophagy and apoptosis induced by MA. These results collectively implied that MA triggers autophagy and apoptosis in EC cells through ROS-mediated ER stress, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent against EC.",

      "abstract": "Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate how miR-200b-3p inhibitors the proliferation and metastasis of endometrial cancer(EC) cells by inducing the expression of FOS-like antigen 2(FOSL2) of activator protein 1(AP1) transcription family. Methods Endometrial cancer cell line HEC-1-A was divided into 12 groups: NC-mimic (transfected with negative control NC mimic), miR-200b-3p mimic (transfected with miR-200b-3p mimic), NC-inhibitor (transfected with negative control NC inhibitor), miR-200b-3p inhibitor group (transfected with miR-200b-3p inhibitor), si-NC (transfected with negative control Si-NC), si-FOSL2 (transfected with si-FOSL2), oe-NC (transfected with negative control oe-NC), oe-FOSL2 group (oe-FOSL2), miR-200b-3p mimic+oe-NC group (co-transfected with miR-200b-3p mimic and oe-NC), miR-200b-3p mimic+oe-FOSL2 group (co-transfected with miR-200b-3p mimic and oe-FOSL2), miR-200b-3p inhibitor+si-NC group (co-transfected with miR-200b-3p inhibitor and si-NC), miR-200b-3p inhibitor+si-FOSL2 group (co-transfected with miR-200b-3p inhibitor and si-FOSL2). Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR, Western blot, CCK-8 assay, scratch test and Transwell assay were used to detect the expression of miR-200b-3p mRNA, FOSL2 mRNA and protein expression level, cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Results In endometrial cancer cell lines, the expression of miR-200b-3p was significantly down-regulated, while the expression of FOSL2 was significantly up-regulated. Compared with NC-mimic group, the expression of FOSL2, N-cadherin and Vimentin in miR-200b-3p mimic group was significantly decreased, and the expression of E-cadherin was significantly increased. The cell proliferation, migration rate and the number of transmembrane cells were significantly decreased. Compared with the miR-200b-3p mimic+oe-NC group, the expression of FOSL2, N-cadherin and Vimentin in miR-200b-3p mimic+oe-FOSL2 group was significantly increased, and the expression level of E-cadherin was significantly decreased, and the cell proliferation, migration rate and the number of transmembrane cells were significantly increased. Compared with NC-inhibitor group, the expression of FOSL2, N-cadherin and Vimentin in miR-200b-3p inhibitor group was significantly increased, and the expression of E-cadherin was significantly decreased. The cell proliferation, migration rate and the number of transmembrane cells were significantly increased. Compared with the miR-200b-3p inhibitor+si-NC group, the expression of FOSL2, N-cadherin and Vimentin in miR-200b-3p inhibitor+si-FOSL2 group was significantly decreased, and the expression of E-cadherin was significantly increased; the cell proliferation, migration rate and the number of transmembrane cells were significantly decreased. Conclusion The expression of miR-200b-3p in endometrial cancer cells is down-regulated, which can inhibitor the proliferation, migration and invasion of endometrial cancer cells by regulating the EMT process, and its mechanism is related to its targeted negative regulation of FOSL2 expression.",

      "abstract": "The protective effect of parity has been demonstrated for cancer of the breast, ovary, and endometrium but no studies have estimated the effect of each subsequent birth in women with 10 or more children or grand-grand parity women, nor compared the linear relationship of the three cancers sites. Here, we aim to explore these relationships based on the Norwegian 1960 Census. The question of parity in present marriage was answered by 385,816 women born 1870-1915, a period with high fertility. Age at marriage has been validated as a proxy for age at first birth AFB. With high parity age at first birth will logically be restricted to early births giving structural zeros. Follow-up was based on linkages to national registers until the first of any of the three diagnoses, death, or age 90 before 31.12.2005. Included were 16,905 breast cancers, 3827 ovarian cancers, and 3834 endometrial cancers. Age- and period-specific incidence rates based on person-years, PY, were used in logit regression models. The percentage decrease for each additional child over the total parity range was for breast cancer 10.5% (95% CI; 9.6-11.4), ovarian cancer 13.2% (11.2-15.3), and endometrial cancer 10.9% (8.9-12.8), in a model without higher order terms. Adjustment for structural zeros reduced the effect of age at first birth to less than one additional child. To the best of our knowledge this is the first analysis of the curvilinear relationships for cancers of the breast, ovary, and endometrium throughout the extended fertility range.",

Preclinical studies have shown that the inhibition of the nuclear export protein XPO1 causes nuclear accumulation of p53 and disruption of NF-\u03baB signaling; both of which are relevant targets for MDS. Selinexor is an XPO1 inhibitor with demonstrated efficacy in MDS patients. Herein, we report three patients with MDS refractory to HMAs, however, when selinexor and venetoclax were added to the treatment regimen, the patients achieved a complete response and a significant reduction in spleen size. All patients successfully underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These cases demonstrate that the combination therapy can achieve CR and significant reductions in spleen size, offering a promising therapeutic option for patients with limited treatment choices. Combination therapy would also offer a potential way for patients to bridge to transplantation. Formal evaluations of this regimen in patients with MDS refractory to HMAs may be meaningful.",

Mechanistically, SEMA7A regulated the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway by binding to the PI3K regulatory subunit p85, exerting its biological function. The NCAPG/LEF1/SEMA7A axis promoted EC tumorigenesis and progression by activating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Additionally, LEF1 and SEMA7A were associated with the FIGO stage, pathological grade, and myometrial invasion in EC patients. The expressions of NCAPG, LEF1, and SEMA7A were highly consistent. Targeting this cascade may provide effective antitumor strategies to delay the progression of EC.",

      "abstract": "The war between humanity and malignant tumors has been ongoing, with continuous advancements in classic chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens, targeted drugs, endocrine therapy, and immunotherapy. However, tumor cells can develop primary or secondary resistance to these treatment options, making the issue of tumor resistance a major factor affecting patient prognosis and leading to recurrence. Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, primarily involved in regulating glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, serving as a central hub for intracellular energy metabolism. ERRs not only mediate insulin resistance but also participate in the mechanisms of drug resistance in various tumors, including breast cancer, osteosarcoma, endometrial cancer, lung cancer, and liver cancer, and even mediate resistance to radiation and immunotherapy. They mainly resist tumor treatment methods through metabolic reprogramming within cells, affecting mitochondrial energy metabolism, regulating metabolites such as cholesterol, glutamine, and lactate, or other signaling pathways, or by influencing the immune microenvironment. ERRs are promising targets for addressing the dilemma of tumor resistance. Currently, electrochemical luminescence biosensors for detecting ERR\u03b1 in bodily fluids have been developed, making large-scale, low-cost detection of ERR\u03b1 possible. Additionally, targeted inhibitors of ERRs have shown significant effects in suppressing cancer cell proliferation and reversing tumor resistance. This article reviews the research progress of ERRs in tumor resistance, providing important references for developing more effective anti-tumor treatment strategies.",

However, DNA sequencing in rare tumors, such as aGCT, often lacks statistical power due to the limited number of cases in each study, thereby clinical implications of DNA alterations are difficult to interpretate. This scoping review aims to systematically describe somatic and germline DNA alterations identified in women with aGCT.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is the most prevalent form of gynecologic malignancy, with a significant surge in incidence among youngsters. Although the advent of the immunotherapy era has profoundly improved patient outcomes, not all patients benefit from immunotherapy; some patients experience hyperprogression while on immunotherapy. Hence, there is a pressing need to further delineate the distinct immune response profiles in patients with endometrial cancer to enhance prognosis prediction and facilitate the prediction of immunotherapeutic responses. The ssGSEA method was used to evaluate the activities of the immune response pathways in patients with endometrial cancer. Unsupervised clustering was employed to identify the different immune response patterns. WGCNA was employed to identify the genes that highly correlated with the immune response patterns observed. Ninety-five machine learning combinations were utilized to identify the optimal prognosis model and the novel biomarker, SLC38A3. Experiments such as cell invasion, migration, scratch, and in vivo tumorigenicity were performed to determine the function of SLC28A3. Molecular docking techniques were employed to determine the targeted action of periodate-oxidized adenosine on SLC38A3. Patients exhibited both immune response-suppressing C1 phenotypes and immune response-activating C2 phenotypes, with significant differences in prognosis between these two phenotypes. WGCNA identified 418 genes that highly correlated with the immune response phenotypes, of which 69 genes were associated with prognosis. The immune response-related score (IRRS) established by multiple machine learning frameworks demonstrated stability in predicting patient prognosis and immune status. High expression of SLC38A3 contributes to cellular malignant traits, and periodate-oxidized adenosine bound stably to SLC38A3. IRRS accurately predicts disease prognosis and immune status in patients with endometrial cancer. SLC38A3 serves as a prognostic marker for these patients and can be stably targeted by periodate-oxidized adenosine.",

      "abstract": "In the last decades the survival of metastatic gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients could have been significantly extended due to the introduction of targeted- and immunotherapy. However, only the minority of patients will experience long-lasting survival. Hence, novel therapeutics are clearly necessary for GI cancer patients. Molecular high-throughput profiling techniques have revealed potential novel targetable molecular alterations, emphasizing the necessity for tailored therapeutic approaches. Nuclear export proteins, particularly Exportin-1 (XPO1), have emerged as promising targets in cancer therapy due to their crucial role in cellular homeostasis and regulation of key cellular functions. Dysregulation of XPO1-mediated nuclear export leads to the functional loss of tumor suppressors and pro-apoptotic factors, facilitating cancer progression. Selinexor, a XPO1 inhibitor, has shown promising activity in preclinical and clinical studies, particularly in hematological malignancies. However, its efficacy in GI cancers remains underexplored. This review aims to elucidate the functional and pathophysiological role of XPO1 in GI cancers. Despite the potential of XPO1 inhibitors in suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis, comprehensive molecular landscape data and validation of selective inhibitors in GI cancers are lacking. Targeting XPO1 presents a significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of GI cancer patients. Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the molecular landscape according to XPO1 expression in GI tumors and to validate the efficacy of selective XPO1 inhibitors. These efforts are expected to contribute to the development of more effective and personalized therapeutic strategies for GI cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Atypical polypoid adenomyoma (APA) is a benign uterine lesion with a premalignant potential and occurs in women of reproductive age. The histological pattern is characterized by irregular epithelial proliferation and muscular stroma. Based on a case report, we performed a systematic review of the literature to assess the main immunohistochemical and molecular markers that contribute to its differential diagnosis against endometrial adenocarcinoma (EC). The distinction is essential for offering to patients a conservative treatment compared to the radical management required for endometrial cancer, a critical issue for the significant physical and psychological consequences that one procedure or another can have on women's health. We performed a meta-analysis of the immunohistochemical markers used for the histological diagnosis of APA, comparing it with our case study. The evaluated markers were beta-catenin, h-caldesmon, desmin, vimentin, smooth muscle alpha-actin, CD10, Ki67, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), pan-cytokeratin, PTEN, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6, p53, MLH1, and p16. Discrepancies were observed in the expression of CD10, h- caldesmon, and p16 when comparing APA with EC. The results of the case evaluated by our team showed beta-catenin nuclear expression and positive immunostaining for pan-cytokeratin, ER, and PR in the glands; smooth muscle actin and desmin positive expression in stromal muscle; and p16 positive immunostaining in squamous morules. Moreover, the c.94G>T p. (Asp132Tyr) mutation in the ",

Traditional TMB prediction methods, such as sequencing exomes or whole genomes, are costly and often unavailable in clinical settings. We present the first TR-MAMIL deep learning framework to predict TMB status and classify the EC cancer subtype directly from H&E-stained WSIs, enabling effective personalized immunotherapy planning and prognostic refinement of EC patients. Our models were evaluated on a large dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas. TR-MAMIL performed exceptionally well in classifying aggressive and non-aggressive EC, as well as predicting TMB, outperforming seven state-of-the-art approaches. It also performed well in classifying normal and abnormal p53 mutations in EC using H&E WSIs. Kaplan-Meier analysis further demonstrated TR-MAMIL's ability to differentiate patients with longer survival in the aggressive EC.",

The purpose of the present study is to reveal the estrogen disruption effect and mechanism of PFBA via estrogen-related receptor \u03b3 (ERR\u03b3) pathways. In vivo experiment indicated that PFBA accumulated in zebrafish ovary and caused ovarian injury, with disturbing sex hormone levels and interfering gene expression related to estrogen synthesis and follicle regulation. In vitro, with cell proliferation assay, PFBA could promote estrogen-sensitive endometrial cancer cell Ishikawa proliferation at lowest observed effective concentrations (LOEC) 10\u202fnM, which was close to human exposure levels. And cell proliferation was inhibited by ERR\u03b3 antagonist GSK5182. By fluorescence competitive binding assay, molecular docking and luciferase reporter gene assays, it demonstrated that PFBA could directly bind with ERR\u03b3 and activate ERR\u03b3 transcriptional activities with a LOEC of 10\u202fnM. Furthermore, PFBA up-regulated the proliferation-related factors downstream of ERR\u03b3 and inhibited by PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002, which also suppressed the cell proliferation induced by PFBA. Taken together, the results revealed that PFBA had estrogen effects at the human-related exposure concentration, and demonstrated a new estrogen effects mechanism of PFBA via ERR\u03b3 pathway.",

Here, we show that ascites-derived and primary tumor HGEC cell lines in 3D spheroid culture faithfully recapitulate key features of malignant peritoneal effusion and exhibit fundamentally distinct transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic landscapes compared with conventional 2D monolayers. Using a genetic screening platform, we identify MAPK14 (which encodes the protein kinase p38\u03b1) as a specific requirement for HGEC in spheroid culture. MAPK14/p38\u03b1 has broad roles in programming the phosphoproteome, transcriptome, and metabolome of HGEC spheroids, yet has negligible impact on monolayer cultures. MAPK14 promotes tumorigenicity in\u00a0vivo and is specifically required to sustain a sub-population of spheroid cells that is enriched in cancer stemness markers. Therefore, spheroid growth of HGEC activates unique biological programs, including p38\u03b1 signaling, that cannot be captured using 2D culture models and are highly relevant to malignant disease pathology.",

      "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) emerge as critical regulators of CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell function within the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). This review explores the multifaceted interplay between miRNAs and CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells across various cancers. We discuss how specific miRNAs influence CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell activation, recruitment, infiltration, and effector function. Dysregulation of these miRNAs can contribute to CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell exhaustion and immune evasion, hindering anti-tumor immunity. Conversely, manipulating miRNA expression holds promise for enhancing CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell activity and improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. We delve into the role of miRNAs in CD8\u2009+\u2009T-cell function across different cancer types, including gliomas, gastric and colon cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, lymphomas, melanoma, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, uterine corpus endometrial cancer, bladder cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and osteosarcoma. Additionally, we explore how extracellular vesicles and cytokines modulate CD8\u2009+\u2009T-cell function through complex interactions with miRNAs. Finally, we discuss the potential impact of radiotherapy and specific drugs on miRNA expression and CD8\u2009+\u2009T-cell activity within the TME. This review highlights the immense potential of targeting miRNAs to manipulate CD8\u2009+\u2009T-cell activity for the development of novel and improved cancer immunotherapies.",

In this study, we explored the feasibility of a nAg-based cancer vaccination design in EC with MMRd. We adopted a whole exome sequencing approach and ad hoc bioinformatics pipelines to characterize FSPs in 35 patients with EC. A mean of 146 mutated mononucleotide repeats (MNRs) was identified with enrichment in the patients' group with MLH1 impairment. A high coverage emerged from the comparative analysis of the EC FSPs with the content of the previously validated NOUS-209 vaccine. We obtained pieces of evidence of FSPs translation as expressed proteins from Ribo-seq, supporting the potential as the target of vaccination. The development of a nAgs-based vaccine strategy in MMRd EC may be further explored.",

Previously reported results showed that C-RT did not improve RFS compared with CT. Here we report the final OS analysis. Patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2009 stage III-IVA UC or stage I/II serous or clear cell UC and positive cytology were enrolled. The primary objective was RFS. Secondary objectives were OS, toxicity, and quality of life. Cumulative probabilities of OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Subgroup analyses of treatment effect for FIGO stage, age, race, gross residual disease, histology, lymph-vascular space invasion, and body mass index were performed. In total, 813 patients were randomly assigned (407 C-RT and 406 CT). The median follow-up was 112 months. Median OS was not achieved in either arm.

The literature was retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, Ovid Medline, and Cochrane Library. The final search was conducted on December 7, 2022. Prospective registration was completed with the PROSPERO with registration number CRD42023477145. This systematic review covered proteomic research on biomarkers for cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. The PANTHER classification system was used to classify the shortlisted candidate biomarkers (CBs), and the STRING database was utilized to visualize protein-protein interaction networks. A total of 23 articles were included in this systematic review. Consistently regulated CBs in the GCs include collagen alpha-2(I) chain, collagen alpha-1(III) chain, collagen alpha-2(V) chain, calreticulin, protein disulfide-isomerase A3, heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, beta polypeptide, fibrinogen alpha chain, fibrinogen gamma chain, apolipoprotein B-100, apolipoprotein C-IV, and apolipoprotein M. In conclusion, collagens, fibrinogens, chaperones, and apolipoproteins were revealed to be replicated in GCs and to be regulated consistently. These CBs contribute to GC etiology and physiology by participating in collagen fibril organization, blood coagulation, protein folding in endoplasmic reticulum, and lipid transporter activity.",

      "abstract": "Survivin belongs to the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family and is encoded by the baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing, or BIRC5, gene. It is preferentially expressed in cancers with functional complexity in cell signaling cascades such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), heat shock protein-90 (HSP90), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and others. Survivin plays a role in cell division and cell death, properties that have attracted a large body of research to decipher its therapeutic and prognostic significance in cancer. Survivin has tumor-promoting effects in endometrial (EC) and ovarian (OC) cancers, and its upregulation in endometrial cancer has been associated with poor overall survival (OS). While survivin protein is abundantly expressed in OC, it is barely detectable in normal ovarian tissue or benign ovarian tumors. Survivin expression is also a marker for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and high-risk human papillomavirus, and a predictor of viral clearance and prognosis in uterine cervical cancer (UCC). Furthermore, nuclear survivin expression is very low in normal vulvar squamous epithelium and increases to become abundant in vulvar invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ISCC), conferring resistance to apoptosis in vulvar carcinogenesis. In this review, we discuss in detail the impact of survivin signaling on gynecological cancers and provide insight on its therapeutic and diagnostic potential, existing research gaps, and areas for future research.",

Immunotherapy has emerged as a transformative approach in the treatment of MMRd due to the high mutation rate and subsequent PD-1/PD-L1 overexpression seen in these tumors. This review analyzes the current landscape of existing randomized clinical trials, highlighting the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like pembrolizumab, avelumab, and dostarlimab. Additionally, the focus extends to the potential of combined therapeutic strategies, such as the integration of ICIs with targeted agents, while also exploring the application of immunotherapy in non-traditional settings beyond advanced or recurrent disease. This includes emerging roles in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant contexts to prevent recurrence and target early-stage disease. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring treatments based on the molecular characteristics of each tumor and paving the way for future advancements in the field of gynecologic oncology. Despite promising results, this article acknowledges the necessity of further research to refine patient selection criteria and explore combination strategies that can overcome resistance mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Cell division cycle 6 (CDC6) is essential for the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells and contributes to the development of various human tumors. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a reproductive endocrine disease in women of childbearing age, with a significant risk of endometrial cancer (EC). However, the role of CDC6 in the progression of PCOS to EC is unclear. Therefore, we examined CDC6 expression in patients with PCOS and EC. We evaluated the relationship between CDC6 expression and its prognostic value, potential biological functions, and immune infiltrates in patients with EC. In vitro analyses were performed to investigate the effects of CDC6 knockdown on EC proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. CDC6 expression was significantly upregulated in patients with PCOS and EC. Moreover, this protein caused EC by promoting the aberrant infiltration of macrophages into the immune microenvironment in patients with PCOS. A functional enrichment analysis revealed that CDC6 exerted its pro-cancer and pro-immune cell infiltration functions via the PI3K-AKT pathway. Moreover, it promoted EC proliferation, migration, and invasion but inhibited apoptosis. This protein significantly reduced EC survival when mutated. These findings demonstrate that CDC6 regulates the progression of PCOS to EC and promotes immune infiltration.",

      "title": "Butyrate as a Potential Modulator in Gynecological Disease Progression.",
      "abstract": "This review investigates the therapeutic potential of butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced by gut microbiota, in the prevention and treatment of various gynecological diseases, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and gynecologic cancers like cervical and ovarian cancer. These conditions often pose treatment challenges, with conventional therapies offering limited and temporary relief, significant side effects, and a risk of recurrence. Emerging evidence highlights butyrate's unique biological activities, particularly its role as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, which allows it to modulate gene expression, immune responses, and inflammation. In PCOS, butyrate aids in restoring hormonal balance, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and reducing chronic inflammation. For endometriosis, butyrate appears to suppress immune dysregulation and minimize lesion proliferation. Additionally, in cervical and ovarian cancers, butyrate demonstrates anticancer effects through mechanisms such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and suppression of tumor progression. Dietary interventions, particularly high-fiber and Mediterranean diets, that increase butyrate production are proposed as complementary approaches, supporting natural microbiota modulation to enhance therapeutic outcomes. However, butyrate's short half-life limits its clinical application, spurring interest in butyrate analogs and probiotics to maintain stable levels and extend its benefits. This review consolidates current findings on butyrate's multifaceted impact across gynecological health, highlighting the potential for microbiota-centered therapies in advancing treatment strategies and improving women's reproductive health.",

      "title": "Murine Xenograft Models as Preclinical Tools in Endometrial Cancer Research.",
      "abstract": "Murine xenograft models are valuable and increasingly used preclinical tools in cancer research to understand disease pathogenesis and guide treatment options. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the studies that employed mouse xenograft models, using cell lines, patient-derived tumors, or organoids, in endometrial cancer (EC) research, detailing their methodology and main findings. We identified 27 articles reporting on heterotopic EC xenografts, including subcutaneous, subrenal capsule, intraperitoneal, and retro-orbital models, and 18 articles using orthotopic xenografts. Subcutaneous xenografts generated using either cell lines or patient tumors have been widely used; however, their low engraftment rates and the inability to recapitulate main clinical features such as metastases limit their translational value. Subrenal capsule models showed improved engraftment rates compared to subcutaneous models, but tumors exhibited slower and constrained tumor growth. Orthotopic models are technically more challenging to generate and monitor, but tumor growth occurs in a relevant microenvironment and EC ortho-xenografts exhibit high engraftment rates and metastases to clinically relevant sites. Cell line-based xenograft (CDX) models are attractive tools because they are convenient, easy to use, and amenable to genetic modifications, making them suitable for proof-of-concept approaches and large-scale studies. EC xenografts developed from patient tumors (PDTXs) are more labor/cost-intensive for their establishment but can capture the genetic and molecular heterogeneity within and across histologic subtypes and can inform personalized patient treatment. EC organoid-based xenograft (PDOX) models combine the advantages of both CDXs and PDTXs since they are more time- and cost-effective, faithfully maintain tumor characteristics and therapeutic responses, and can be genetically modified. Despite substantial progress in EC management, there are still several unmet needs. Efficient targeted treatments are currently indicated only for a small subgroup of patients, while women with recurrent or advanced-stage EC have very few therapeutic options and their prognosis remains unfavorable. Novel (targeted) drugs, combinational regimens and tools to predict the real drug response in patients are urgently needed. Xenograft models are expected to inform about disease mechanisms and to help identify novel therapeutic options and suitable target patients.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is one of the most common gynecological malignancies, and while early-stage cases are highly treatable, recurrent or advanced EC remains challenging to manage. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, has revolutionized treatment approaches in oncology, and its application in EC has shown promising results. Key to immunotherapy efficacy in EC is the tumor's mismatch repair status, with MMR-deficient tumors demonstrating a higher tumor mutational burden and increased PD-L1 expression, making them more susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as pembrolizumab, durvalumab, and dostarlimab. However, not all mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) tumors respond to ICIs, particularly those with a \"cold\" tumor microenvironment (TME) characterized by poor immune infiltration. In contrast, some MMR-proficient tumors with a \"hot\" TME respond well to ICIs, underscoring the complex interplay between MMR status, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and TME. To overcome resistance in cold tumors, novel therapies, including Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are being explored, offering targeted immune-based strategies to enhance treatment efficacy. This review discusses the current understanding of immunotherapy in EC, emphasizing the prognostic and therapeutic implications of MMR status, TME composition, and emerging cell-based therapies.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial mucinous carcinoma of the gastric [gastrointestinal] type (MCG) is a rare, possibly aggressive subtype of endometrial cancer that should be distinguished from its potential mimics, including endometrioid carcinoma (EEC). Herein, we assess the frequency of gastric and gastrointestinal immunophenotypes in EEC without any discernible gastric/gastrointestinal-type morphology. Immunohistochemical analyses for KRT(CK)7, KRT20, CDX2, ER, SATB2, MUC6, PAX8, and HIK1083 were performed on 81 EEC, inclusive of consecutively archived low grade [with (n\u00a0=\u00a022) and without (n\u00a0=\u00a047) mucinous differentiation] and high grade (n\u00a0=\u00a012) cases. None displayed gastric-type morphology or goblet cells. Expression levels were semi-quantified as H-scores (combining intensity and extent of staining) on a standardized 0-300 scale. Among the gastric/gastrointestinal-type markers, 56%, 62%, 23%, 25%, and 0% of cases expressed MUC6, CDX2, KRT20, SATB2, and HIK1083 respectively. The expression levels for positive cases were generally limited, with average H-scores being 49.5 [range 1-250] for MUC6, 33.7 [1-285] for CDX2, 24.0 [1-270] for CK20, and 30.5 [2-220] for SATB2. Ten (12.35%) cases showed high expression (H\u00a0\u2265\u00a0200) of at least 1 gastric/gastrointestinal-type marker, including 1, 2, 2 and 6 cases that were high positive for KRT20, SATB2, CDX2 and MUC6 respectively. Immunoreactive foci were generally indistinguishable from background at the morphologic level. There was no statistically significant correlation between the expression of any of the gastric/gastrointestinal-type markers and ER, KRT7 or PAX8 expression. In summary, gastric/gastrointestinal-type proteins are not uncommonly expressed at low levels in EEC. As such, positivity for these markers cannot be the sole basis for distinguishing EEC from MCG.",

Bioinformatics analyses were employed to assess KIF22 and TFDP1 expression in UCEC, examining their prognostic value and associations with disease progression. Expression levels were validated in UCEC tissues using qRT-PCR and western blotting. Potential TFDP1 binding sites on the KIF22 promoter were predicted using the JASPAR database and confirmed via dual-luciferase reporter assays. Functional assays, including CCK-8, transwell, and spheroid formation assays, were conducted to evaluate the effects of KIF22 knockdown on UCEC cell behavior. A mouse xenograft model was utilized to investigate the in vivo impact of KIF22 suppression on tumor growth and stemness. KIF22 expression was significantly elevated in UCEC tissues, correlating with reduced overall survival in patients with high KIF22 levels. Overexpression of KIF22 enhanced the proliferation, migration, and sphere formation of UCEC cells. Similarly, high TFDP1 expression was associated with poorer patient outcomes. KIF22 was found to be positively regulated by the TFDP1 transcription factor, which bound to the KIF22 promoter and activated its expression in UCEC cells. In vivo, KIF22 knockdown markedly impeded the tumor formation of cells and reduced stemness marker expression. KIF22, upregulated by TFDP1, enhances UCEC cell aggressiveness and is linked to poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in endometrial cancer.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the three most common malignancies of the female reproductive system. SIRT3 is an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that maintains the stability of the intracellular environment. This study aims to investigate the mechanism of SIRT3 in regulating apoptosis in endometrial cancer and further reveal the role of SIRT3 in endometrial cancer. Differential expression of SIRT3 in tumors was analyzed by GEPIA using TCGA database data. Meanwhile, mRNA and protein expression levels of SIRT3 in tissues and cells were examined using RT-qPCR, Western Blot, and immunohistochemistry. The expression of SIRT3 after estradiol (E2) stimulation of Ishikawa cells was detected using RT-qPCR and Western Blot techniques. The effect of transfection after SIRT3 knockdown and overexpression was verified using RT-qPCR and Western Blot. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assay were used to detect the effect of SIRT3 on apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was used to detect the effect of SIRT3 on the level of oxidative stress in cells. The expression of apoptotic protein (BAX, cleaved-Caspase 3) and autophagy protein (cyto C and LC3A) were detected in transfected Ishikawa cell. Differences analysis of TCGA database data showed that the expression of SIRT3 in EC was significantly lower than that in normal endometrial tissue. The mRNA and protein levels of SIRT3 were significantly lower in EC tissues or cells than normal controls. E2 stimulation in Ishikawa cells resulted in the down-regulation of SIRT3 expression. After transfection, SIRT3 promoted the apoptosis of Ishikawa cells and attenuated the levels of ROS. Overexpression of SIRT3 promoted apoptosis and autophagy-related proteins. Thus, high expression of SIRT3 inhibits the development of EC whereas low expression of SIRT3 may promote the progression of EC, which provides a new direction for studying the treatment of EC.",

      "abstract": "CD47 is an immune-regulatory protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin family. It inhibits the phagocytic ability of immune cells. So, it is related to an unfavorable outcome in leukemia and various solid tumors. One of the immune checkpoint molecules is cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) which interferes with anticancer immunity and has an important role in anti-cancer surveillance. This study aimed to investigate CD47 and CTLA-4 mRNA and protein expressions in relation to P53 mutation and different clinicopathological parameters in endometrial carcinoma (EC). We also investigated the relation between CD47 and CTLA-4 expressions in EC.",

      "abstract": "The molecular-based detection of microsatellite instability (MSI) in endometrial cancer is complex, due to the low sensitivity of PCR and a lack of standardization in next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods. In the present study, sequenced data were obtained from an NGS panel following the addition of five commonly used microsatellite loci. Subsequently, a novel algorithm, namely MSIPeak, was developed for data analysis. Results of the present study demonstrated that MSI data obtained using MSIPeak were presented in a peak, using a threshold of 1.10 to distinguish stable and unstable loci. MSIPeak was further validated using synthetic DNA samples and endometrial cancer tissue and the results were compared with the immunohistochemical analysis-determined mismatch repair status. The PCR results demonstrated a 3-base-pair (bp) deletion in synthetic DNA samples, compared with 1- and 2-bp deletion controls. Results obtained using MSIPeak demonstrated notable differences in peak profiles and positive scores in synthetic DNA samples with 1-, 2- and 3-bp deletions, compared with controls. Thus, the results of the present study demonstrated that NGS-based MSI detection exhibited a higher sensitivity compared with PCR. In addition, NGS-based MSI detection exhibited higher levels of repeatability and applicability compared with other MSI-NGS-based methods, such as MSISensor2 and MANTIS. Collectively, the results of the present study highlighted that the combination of MSIPeak and NGS exhibits potential in the detection of cancer.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer poses a significant threat to women's health. Doxorubicin is commonly used in chemotherapy for advanced and recurrent cases; however, low sensitivity frequently limits its effectiveness. In this study, we verified that SRC modulates the sensitivity of endometrial cancer to chemotherapy of doxorubicin and developed a targeted silencing drug delivery platform that employs rolling circle amplification and dual-multivalent aptamers to precisely deliver therapeutics directly to tumor cells. This platform enhanced endometrial cancer cell sensitivity to doxorubicin by modulating drug responsiveness at the genetic level. Our results suggest that this approach may improve cancer cell susceptibility to ferroptosis. The efficacy and safety of this platform were validated in both cellular and animal models. This study provides a new solution for realizing the precision treatment of endometrial cancer and lays a theoretical foundation for exploring the mechanism of endometrial cancer.",

      "abstract": "A germline alteration in the PTEN gene causes a spectrum of disorders conceptualized as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which show high risk of tumor development and a highly variable and\u00a0complex phenotype. The diagnosis of PHTS is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous germline PTEN pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. In this study, to understand more PTEN-associated clinical phenotype and PHTS in a Japanese population, we extracted 128 germline PTEN rare variants from 113,535 adult Japanese registered in Biobank Japan (BBJ), and categorized 29 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 30 individuals (0.0264%) with ClinVar classifications and ACMG/AMP guideline for PTEN. We examined case-control association in 75,238 patients with various types of cancer and 38,297 non-cancer controls, and identified that PTEN pathogenic variants (PVs) were significantly associated with endometrial cancer (OR\u2009=\u200935.7, P\u2009=\u20099.73E-04) and marginally associated with female breast cancer (OR\u2009=\u200919.5, P\u2009=\u20093.92E-03), especially at young onset and with multiple cancers. We observed that among the 127 disease phenotypes the PTEN PV carriers had uterine fibroid, goiter, ovarian cyst, and epilepsy, which is consistent with PTEN-related phenotypes. We also found that weight/height were significantly higher in adult female carriers with PTEN PV (P\u2009=\u20093.1E-04 and P\u2009=\u20090.0014, respectively), which is consistent with overgrowth syndrome of PHTS. Our results indicate the phenotypical features associated with PTEN PVs in a Japanese population, especially female, and can contribute to the screening for PTEN variants and its associated several phenotypes.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the efficacy of machine learning and radiomics of preoperative multiparameter MRIs in predicting low- vs high-risk histopathologic features and early vs advanced FIGO stage (IA vs IB or higher) in endometrial cancer. This retrospective study of patients with endometrial cancer histologically confirmed from 2008 through 2023 excluded those with: (a) previous treatment for endometrial carcinoma, (b) incomplete MRI examinations or low-quality MR images, (c) incomplete pathology reports, (d) non-visualized tumors on MRI, or (e) distant metastases. In total, 110 radiomic features were extracted using commercial PACS built-in software following segmentation after sagittal T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), contrast enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI), and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). The radiomic features from each imaging sequence were utilized for initial modeling. A combined model, which included features retained from all 3 sequences, was then established. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) determined the efficacy of each model. For 5 specific histopathologic features, the combined model achieved AUCs of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.85-0.90), 0.90 (95% CI, 0.88-0.92), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.87-0.90), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.86-0.92), and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.86-0.90). This model incorporated 38 radiomic features: 12 from T2WI, 17 from CE-T1WI, and 9 from DWI. In conclusion, an MRI radiomics-based model can differentiate between early- and advanced-stage endometrial cancer and between low- and high-risk histologic markers, giving it the potential to predict high risk and stratify preoperative risk in those with endometrial cancer. The findings may aid personalized preoperative assessments to guide clinical decision-making in endometrial cancer.",

Maackiain (MA) is a natural compound isolated from common herbal medicines, that has been reported to have anti-cancer effects. However, the underlying roles and mechanisms concerning EC remain unclear. This study focused on deeply exploring the potential roles and mechanisms of MA against EC by network pharmacology, experimentally validated, metabolomics, and molecular docking. A total of 86 potential targets of MA against EC were identified by network pharmacology. In vitro experiments further confirmed network pharmacology' predictions. In addition to suppressing EC cell proliferation, MA also paused the cell cycle at the G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner. This effect is accompanied by increased p21 and phospho-p53 expression, as well as reduced expression of CDK1 and CCNB1. Furthermore, cell metabolomics analysis revealed that 285 metabolites were changed after MA administration, which majorly affects glycerophospholipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, choline metabolism in cancer, and purine metabolism. Combination network pharmacology, metabolomics, and molecular docking, PLA2G10, PDE4D, and PDE5A were found to be potential targets for therapeutic intervention. These findings underlined that MA has anti-EC potential by modulating multiple targets including PLA2G10, PDE4D, and PDE5A, inhibiting EC cell proliferation, inducing G2/M phase arrest, and causing metabolic shifts. This study provides theoretical support for advanced experimental research on its clinical applications.",

Here, we investigated the immunopeptidome of HLA class II-positive (HLA-II+) endometrial cancer with an inflamed TME using a proteogenomic approach. We identified HLA-II neoantigens, one of which induced polyclonal CD4+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte responses. We then experimentally demonstrated that neoantigen-specific CD4+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes lyse target cells in an HLA-II-dependent manner. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the TME coupled with T-cell receptor sequencing revealed the presence of CD4+ T-cell clusters characterized by CXCL13 expression. The CXCL13+ clusters contained two subclusters with distinct cytotoxic gene expression patterns. The identified neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells were found exclusively in one of the CXCL13+ subclusters characterized by granzyme B and CCL5 expression. These results demonstrate the involvement of tumor-reactive CD4+ T cells with cytotoxic function in immune surveillance of endometrial cancer and reveal their transcriptomic signature.",

      "abstract": "The burden of uterine cancer is growing and, in the US and UK, mortality rates are poorest among black women. Early detection of these cancers is critical and poor performance of ultrasound in black women may contribute to adverse outcomes. Limited data on this topic are available from Africa. We assessed whether a simple DNA methylation test, the WID-qEC, enables detection of all epithelial uterine (endometrial and cervical) cancers in women presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in Ghana. Among 118 women \u226540\u2009years presenting with AUB, 106 consented to the study and a cervicovaginal sample was obtained for WID-qEC testing. Subsequent to ultrasound assessment 102 women had a cervical or endometrial biopsy. Histopathology, ultrasound and WID-qEC testing were analyzed and compared. Among the 102 volunteers, 8 and 15 were diagnosed with endometrial and cervical cancer (EC and CC), respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) was 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.86) for sonographic endometrial thickness (ET) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.94-1.00) for the WID-qEC test. Sensitivity and specificity of the prespecified ET \u22655\u2009mm were 66.7% (95% CI 24.1-94.0) and 22.7 (95% CI 12.0-38.2) and for the prespecified WID-qEC SUM-PMR\u2009\u2265\u20090.3 were 100% (95% CI 56.1-100.0) and 76.1 (96%CI 60.9-86.9), respectively. In addition, 15 CCs were detected by the WID-qEC test [sensitivity 100% (95% CI 74.7-100.0)]. The WID-qEC test accurately detects both EC and CC in black women presenting with AUB.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic malignancy with increasing incidence and mortality. The tumor immune microenvironment significantly impacts cancer prognosis. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) is a systems biology approach that analyzes gene expression data to uncover gene co-expression networks and functional modules. This study aimed to use WGCNA to develop a prognostic prediction model for EC based on immune cell infiltration, and to identify new potential therapeutic targets. WGCNA was performed using the Cancer Genome Atlas Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma dataset to identify hub modules associated with T-lymphocyte cell infiltration. Prognostic models were developed using LASSO regression based on genes in these hub modules. The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins was used for protein-protein interaction network analysis of the hub module. Gene Set Variation Analysis identified differential gene enrichment analysis between high- and low-risk groups. The relationship between the model and microsatellite instability, tumor mutational burden, and immune cell infiltration was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas data. The model's correlation with chemotherapy and immunotherapy resistance was examined using the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and Cancer Immunome Atlas databases. Immunohistochemical staining of EC tissue microarrays was performed to analyze the relationship between the expression of key genes and immune infiltration. The green-yellow module was identified as a hub module, with 4 genes (ARPC1B, BATF, CCL2, and COTL1) linked to CD8+ T cell infiltration. The prognostic model constructed from these genes showed satisfactory predictive efficacy. Differentially expressed genes in high- and low-risk groups were enriched in tumor immunity-related pathways. The model correlated with EC-related phenotypes, indicating its potential to predict immunotherapeutic response. Basic leucine zipper activating transcription factor-like transcription factor(BATF) expression in EC tissues positively correlated with CD8+ T cell infiltration, suggesting BATF's crucial role in EC development and antitumor immunity. The prognostic model comprising ARPC1B, BATF, CCL2, and COTL1 can effectively identify high-risk EC patients and predict their response to immunotherapy, demonstrating significant clinical potential. These genes are implicated in EC development and immune infiltration, with BATF emerging as a potential therapeutic target for EC.",

      "abstract": "The transcription factor GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3) and the transcriptional program it regulates have emerged as oncogenic drivers across diverse T-cell lymphomas (TCLs), many of which are resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents and characterized by recurrent losses of key tumor suppressor genes, including TP53 and PTEN, both of which are clients of the nuclear export protein XPO1. Here, we demonstrated that XPO1 is highly expressed by malignant T cells expressing GATA-3 and by lymphoma-associated macrophages (LAMs) within their tumor microenvironment (TME). Using complementary genetically engineered mouse models, we demonstrated that TP53- and/or phosphate and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deficient TCLs, and LAMs within their TME, are sensitive to the selective exportin-1 (XPO1) antagonist selinexor. In an effort to identify TP53- and PTEN-independent mechanisms, we used complementary and orthogonal approaches to investigate the role of eIF4E and XPO1-dependent messenger RNA nuclear export in these TCLs. We identified a novel role for eIF4E/XPO1 in exporting GATA-3 and GATA-3-dependent transcripts from the nucleus in TCLs, and in the export of therapeutically relevant transcripts, including colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor, from LAMs. Therefore, XPO1 antagonism, by impairing oncogenic transcriptional programs in TCLs and depleting LAMs from their TME, is a novel approach to target 2 independent dependencies in a group of therapeutically challenging TCLs.",

Moreover, it is an epithelial cancer that develops in the endometrium, which is classified as either estrogen-dependent (type I) or non-estrogen-dependent (type II). Non-estrogen-dependent endometrial cancers include plasma cell carcinoma and undifferentiated/dedifferentiated endometrial carcinoma. Undifferentiated endometrial carcinoma is a rare but aggressive endometrial epithelial cancer that lacks any histologic differentiation and is classified as a high-grade endometrial cancer. This case presents that a patient had uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma during perimenopausal hormone therapy, and the patient was treated with sequential estrogen-progestin treatment for 3 years. During that period, she did not undergo a follow-up examination for the last 2 years due to the pandemic. Undifferentiated endometrial carcinoma is a special type of endometrial cancer that is not hormone-dependent, and whether the occurrence of this case is related to perimenopausal hormone therapy needs to be verified by more evidence-based clinical cases and further studies.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the occurrence of synchronous or metachronous hematologic and gynecologic malignancies. The medical database of the pathology department at a tertiary center was searched from 2016 to 2024 for cases involving both hematologic and gynecologic tumors. A literature search using Google Scholar and PubMed was also conducted between May and June 2024. Articles reporting surgical pathology data were included, while radiologic studies and those lacking pathology data were excluded. Cases involving one gynecologic cancer and one hematologic malignancy were analyzed. Three cases from our center and 25 cases from 15 English-language articles were identified. The mean age of the cases at diagnosis was 61.4\u2009\u00b1\u20099.4\u2009years. A total of 19 patients (68%) were diagnosed with synchronous cancers, while the rest had metachronous diagnoses. Endometrial cancer was seen in 20 cases (71.4%): 14 synchronous and five metachronous endometrioid adenocarcinomas, and one unspecified metachronous endometrial cancer. This was followed by five cases of ovarian cancer (17.9%): three synchronous serous ovarian carcinomas, one metachronous serous ovarian carcinoma, and one synchronous ovarian adenocarcinoma. Additionally, there were two cases of cervical cancer (7.1%): one synchronous adenosquamous carcinoma and one metachronous invasive squamous carcinoma, and one case of carcinosarcoma (3.6%). Involvement of more than one site is possible for hematolymphoid cancer, commonly affecting the pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes in 16 patients (57.1%), with other sites including the cervix (4 cases, 14.3%), ovary (4 cases, 14.3%), uterus (2 cases, 7.1%), iliac/inguinal lymph nodes (2 cases, 7.1%), fallopian tube (1 case, 3.6%), vagina (1 case, 3.6%), liver (1 case, 3.6%), abdomen (1 case, 3.6%), and appendix (1 case, 3.6%). Two cases were unspecified. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), primarily of B cell lineage, was the most common hematologic malignancy (25 cases, 89.3%, with 22 cases being B cell lineage). In contrast, Hodgkin lymphoma was observed in two cases (7.1%), and acute leukemia in one case (3.6%). Among 21 patients with available follow-up data, eight died during the follow-up period. The co-occurrence of NHL, Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute leukemia with gynecologic cancers is rare. However, during surgery for gynecologic cancers, the potential of synchronous lymphoma should be considered, particularly in cases with unusual retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (ECs) stands as one of the three major malignancies impacting females globally, with its incidence steadily increasing. ECs can be categorized into two types based on their clinicopathological features. Type I ECs typically exhibit low stage, favorable histological types, and low histological grade, correlating with a more favorable prognosis. Conversely, Type II ECs present with advanced-stage disease, aggressive behavior, and poorer histological types, resulting in a worse prognosis. The expression level of progesterone receptors (PR) holds significant importance in determining the prognosis of patients with ECs. Elevated levels of PR are linked to a more favorable prognosis, primarily attributed to progesterone's inhibitory influence on cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Moreover, progesterone promotes cell cycle inhibition through its regulation of PR, further contributing to improved outcomes in ECs. Nicalin (NCLN) plays a crucial role in facilitating the translocation of multichannel membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is implicated in embryonic development. Structurally akin to NODAL Modulator (NOMO), NCLN antagonizes NOMO during embryogenesis, forming a complex that antagonizes the Nodal pathway, thereby influencing mesoderm development. However, the precise relationship between NCLN and ECs remains incompletely understood. Our research findings reveal that NCLN actively stimulates the proliferation of ECs cells and exhibits a positive correlation with PR, albeit without impacting ER. Moreover, the expression levels of NCLN in ECs demonstrate associations with distinct histological types. These observations suggest that NCLN could emerge as a promising marker in the histological classification of ECs.",

Recently, Trastuzumab-Deruxtecan (T-DXd) has shown substantial efficacy in HER2 overexpressing carcinomas, most prominently in ovarian, endometrial and cervical patients. We have examined the efficacy of T-DXd in patients with metastatic endometrial, ovarian and cervical malignancies that were treated in the Department of Clinical Therapeutics, Alexandra Hospital, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.MethodsPatients with gynecological malignancies with HER2 expression 2\u2009+\u2009/3\u2009+\u2009as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) that were treated with T-DXd were retrospectively identified. Patients received T-DXd intravenously at a dose of 5.4\u00a0mg/kg every 3\u00a0weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.ResultsIn total, 10 patients treated with T-DXd for recurrent/metastatic disease were identified. Regarding histology, there were 5 patients with uterine neoplasms (serous carcinoma (n\u2009=\u20093), uterine carcinosarcoma (n\u2009=\u20091), uterine leiomyosarcoma (n\u2009=\u20091)), 1 patient with squamous cervical carcinoma and 4 patients with ovarian cancer (ovarian carcinosarcoma (n\u2009=\u20092), high-grade serous carcinoma (n\u2009=\u20091) and mucinous ovarian carcinoma (n\u2009=\u20091)). Median age was 65.4\u00a0years (25th-75th percentile, 58.1-75.2\u00a0years). 5 patients had HER2 expression 3\u2009+\u2009by IHC and 5 patients had HER2 expression 2\u2009+\u2009. Median number of previous lines of therapy was 4 (range 2-6), 2 patients with uterine serous carcinoma were pretreated with trastuzumab and 4 patients had already received immunotherapy. In the entire cohort median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.4\u00a0months (95%CI 0.8-9.8\u00a0months). Regarding responses, 5 patients had partial response (including 2 patients that were pretreated with trastuzumab), 1 patient had stable disease at 12\u00a0weeks and 4 patients had disease progression at initial assessment. All patients but one that derived clinical benefit had HER2 3\u2009+\u2009expression.DiscussionIn the real-world setting, T-DXd\u00a0showed activity in a cohort of heavily pre-treated patients with HER2-expressing gynecological malignancies.",

      "abstract": "Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the ovary, an uncommon form of gynecologic cancer, typically originates from the malignant transformation of a pre-existing mature ovarian teratoma (MOT). However, due to its rarity, the molecular pathways driving its development are not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we performed molecular inversion probe (MIP) array analysis and targeted sequencing of 275 cancer susceptibility genes on 11 ovarian SCC samples derived from MOTs. Additionally, we conducted the same molecular tests on two samples of ovarian metastases of SCCs that originated from primary sites outside the ovary, specifically, one from endometrial cancer and one from cervical SCC. Utilizing MIP arrays, we identified failures in meiosis I and II, as well as instances of endoreduplication within haploid ova, in five, two, and four samples of ovarian SCCs arising from MOTs, respectively. Notably, such alterations were absent in samples of ovarian metastases, implying that primary ovarian SCCs may derive from teratoma cells. Targeted sequencing identified TP53 as the most frequently mutated gene in ovarian SCCs, occurring in 82% of cases. This was followed by mutations in PIK3CA (36%), PTEN (27%), and KMT2D (27%). Furthermore, mutations in CDKN2A and copy number loss of 9p21.3 were observed in 54.5% of the cohort. In summary, our study elucidates the germ cell origin of ovarian SCC and provides a comprehensive analysis of its genomic landscape, which may assist in differential diagnosis and inform the development of targeted therapies with potential clinical benefits. KEY MESSAGES: Failures in meiosis I/II and endoreduplication found in primary ovarian SCCs.\u00a0 Ovarian SCCs may derive from germ cells in mature teratomas.\u00a0 Alterations absent in ovarian metastases from SCC aid differential diagnosis. TP53 mutations found in 82% of ovarian SCC cases. CDKN2A mutations and 9p21.3 loss observed in 54.5% of ovarian SCC cohort.",

      "abstract": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is an important genomic biomarker for cancer diagnosis and treatment, and sequencing-based approaches are often applied to identify MSI because of its fastness and efficiency. These approaches, however, may fail to identify MSI on one or more sub-clones for certain cancers with a high degree of heterogeneity, leading to erroneous diagnoses and unsuitable treatments. Besides, the computational cost of identifying sub-clonal MSI can be exponentially increased when multiple sub-clones with different length distributions share MSI status. Herein, this paper proposes \"scMSI\", an accurate and efficient estimation of sub-clonal MSI to identify the microsatellite status. scMSI is an integrative Bayesian method to deconvolute the mixed-length distribution of sub-clones by a novel alternating iterative optimization procedure based on a subtle generative model. During the process of deconvolution, the optimized division of each sub-clone is attained by a heuristic algorithm, aligning with clone proportions that adhere optimally to the sample's clonal structure. To evaluate the performance, 16 patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer, exhibiting positive responses to the treatment despite having negative MSI status based on sequencing-based approaches, were considered. Excitingly, scMSI reported MSI on sub-clones successfully, and the findings matched the conclusions on immunohistochemistry. In addition, testing results on a series of experiments with simulation datasets concerning a variety of impact factors demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of scMSI in detecting MSI on sub-clones over existing approaches. scMSI provides a new way of detecting MSI for cancers with a high degree of heterogeneity.",

      "abstract": "Lower limb lymphedema (LLL) is a common postoperative complication following lymphadenectomy in cervical and endometrial cancers. Removal of the circumflex iliac nodes distal to the external iliac node (CINDEIN) is associated with LLL. Here, we sought to evaluate whether preserving the CINDEIN is helpful in reducing the incidence of LLL in women with cervical and endometrial cancers and to evaluate the safety of preserving CINDEIN. In this prospective randomized controlled trial, patients with clinical stage I A2 to II A cervical cancer and stage I to III endometrial carcinoma undergoing surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo pelvic lymphadenectomy with CINDEIN removal or preservation. The primary endpoint was the incidence of LLL at 24 months post-surgery. Eligible patients underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping with carbon nanoparticles (CNP). The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number ChiCTR2300071911. Between Jun 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2018, 328 participants were randomly assigned to the two groups. Thirteen patients were excluded from the lymphedema analysis. A total of 158 patients in the CINDEIN preservation group and 157 in the CINDEIN removal group completed the follow-up examination. At baseline, no significant differences were observed between the two groups. The 3-year overall survival rate was 96.9% in the preservation group and 95.7% in the resection group. For cervical cancer and endometrial carcinoma, the incidence of LLL were significantly lower in the preservation group than in the removal group both at 24 months. No differences in the occurrence time of LLL were observed between the two groups. The LLL stages also showed no significant difference between the two groups. In the removal group, no CINDEIN metastases were identified in any patient. A total of 125 evaluable patients received the injection of CNP. None of the patients had CINDEIN detected as SLNs. CINDEIN removal is an important risk factor for LLL following lymphadenectomy in cervical and endometrial cancers. The metastasis rate of CINDEIN in cervical cancer and early endometrial cancer is relatively low, and preserving CINDEIN might be safe and helpful in reducing the occurrence of LLL.",

Despite advancements in diagnosis and treatment, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of these cancers remain poorly understood. Recent studies have implicated translational machinery (ribosomal proteins (RPs) and translation factors (TFs)) as potential drivers of oncogenic processes in various cancer types, including gynecologic cancers. RPs are essential components of the ribosome, which is responsible for protein synthesis. In this review paper, we aim to explore the role of translational machinery in gynecologic cancers. Specifically, we will investigate the potential mechanisms by which these components contribute to the oncogenic processes in these cancers and evaluate the feasibility of targeting RPs as a potential therapeutic strategy. By doing so, we hope to provide a broader view of the molecular pathogenesis of gynecologic cancers and highlight their potential as novel therapeutic targets for the management of these challenging diseases.",

This study aimed to investigate the potential genetic links between PE and EC, identify key prognostic genes, and develop a risk model to predict overall survival in EC patients. We conducted comprehensive genetic and molecular analyses, revealing significant overlaps in immune and angiogenic pathways between PE and EC. Through LASSO regression and multivariate Cox analysis, we identified five core prognostic genes-FSTL3, PRSS23, IGFBP4, MYDGF, and TSC22D3-that were used to construct a risk model. This model effectively stratified EC patients into high- and low-risk groups, with significant differences in overall survival. Patients in the low-risk group exhibited better 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival outcomes and had higher immune cell infiltration and expression of immune checkpoint-related genes, indicating a more favorable tumor microenvironment. Additionally, the analysis showed that these genes are also implicated in the pathogenesis of PE, highlighting potential shared molecular mechanisms. Our findings suggest that these PE-related genes may serve as valuable prognostic biomarkers for EC and could lead to improved prognostic tools and personalized treatment strategies for EC patients.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer primarily undergoes surgical intervention, with adjuvant treatments such as external beam pelvic radiotherapy, vaginal brachytherapy, chemotherapy, and combined therapy investigated in randomized trials. Treatment decisions hinge on clinicopathological risk factors. Low-risk cases usually require surgery alone, whereas high-intermediate risk often benefit from adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy for enhanced local control with minimal side effects. Recent trials advocate pelvic radiotherapy for high-risk cases, particularly in Stage I-II tumors with risk factors. Chemoradiation proves advantageous for serous cancers and Stage III disease, improving recurrence-free, and overall survival. Molecular studies, notably the Cancer Genome Atlas project, identified four distinct molecular classes, transcending stages, and histological types. These molecular subtypes exhibit a stronger prognostic impact than histopathological characteristics, heralding a shift toward molecular-integrated diagnostics and treatments. Incorporating molecular factors into adjuvant strategies, including targeted therapies, marks a new paradigm in endometrial cancer management, underpinning ongoing research, and clinical trials. This review outlines current adjuvant approaches, underscores the emergence of molecular-integrated risk profiling, and touches on developments in targeted therapy.",

However, there is great variability on whether and how this is undertaken in different institutions, and this is often dependent on resources and availability of molecular testing. Points of controversy include whether molecular classification is needed on all endometrial carcinomas and whether pure molecular testing is undertaken or a surrogate such as the ProMisE (Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Cancer) Classifier. Herein we report our experience instigating molecular classification of endometrial carcinomas in Northern Ireland.",

This study focused on the prognostic significance of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in EC, highlighting the pivotal role of SLC3A2. To predict EC patient outcomes, we developed a model centered on DRGs, employing LASSO-Cox regression for its construction. The model revealed a strong correlation between DRG risk score, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA), clinical characteristics, the tumor microenvironment (TME), and the response to immunotherapy. Key genes were pinpointed using random forest maps. To establish SLC3A2's oncogenic effects in EC, we conducted comprehensive studies including apoptosis, cell cycle, TRANSWELL, CCK-8, and tumor xenograft assays. SLC3A2 expression was further confirmed via qRT-PCR. The impact of SLC3A2 on EC's malignant behavior was corroborated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic cancer. Unfortunately, its prognosis remains poor due to limited screening and treatment options. To address this issue, the present study evaluated the predictive value of four immunohistochemical (IHC) indicators for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with EC. A total of 834 patients diagnosed with EC were included at Peking University People's Hospital between January 2006 and December 2020. These patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts at a 2:1 ratio, collecting data on clinicopathological information and IHC indicators. A total of 92 combinations of algorithms were assessed using the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation framework to identify the one with the highest C-index. To estimate the accuracy of the factors and four IHC indicators for predicting both OS and RFS, survival curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used. Independent predictors included estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, body mass index, P53, FIGO stage, histology, grade, Ki67, ascites and lymph node metastasis. Both the training and validation cohorts exhibited excellent predictive performance for OS and RFS, as demonstrated by ROC curves at 1-year, 3-year and 5-year follow-ups. By introducing a model based solely on clinicopathological information as model 1 and adding four IHC indicators in model 2, a significant improvement was observed in the area under the curve (AUC) values across the entire sample. The AUC value for OS curves increased from 0.765 to 0.872, and the AUC for RFS curves rose from 0.791 to 0.882. Thus, the present study's model effectively predicts patients' probability of OS and RFS using these factors. This prediction capability can guide postoperative treatment plans and follow-up intervals, potentially enhancing long-term survival for patients with EC.",

This case report details a modified brachytherapy approach for a 59-year-old female patient who was known to have multiple comorbidities, poor performance status, and progressive slowness in activities of daily living. She presented with a complaint of post-menopausal bleeding per vaginum, for which she underwent investigations and was diagnosed with a case of endometrial adenocarcinoma, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA and grade I. After the tumor board discussion, the patient was deemed medically inoperable and planned for radical radiotherapy. She received EBRT via the image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique, a dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions to the uterus, cervix, and upper 2 cm of the vagina, followed by weekly intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT), a dose of 4.5 Gy in the first fraction via the Rotte-Y applicator and 5.2 Gy in the second and third fractions each via the modified Rotte-Y applicator. The modified applicator demonstrated better coverage of the target with a lesser dose to the organs at risk (OARs) and underscores its potential use in the future for such cases.",

      "abstract": "Endometriosis is an oestrogen-dependent inflammatory disease affecting menstruating women, with varying levels of severity. Oestrogen dysregulation is responsible for chronic inflammation, angiogenesis, endometrial lesion development, progression, and infertility during menarche in afflicted women. The inflammatory mediators associated with this chronic painful disease have been established, with research also indicating the relationship between dysbiosis and disease manifestation. Endometriosis is also present with several painful comorbidities, including endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmunity. The lack of specific and sensitive non-invasive diagnostic procedures, coupled with poor response to current therapeutic approaches, means that treatment needs remain unmet. Surgical procedures are performed to remove endometriosis ectopic lesions, for which the recurrence rate of disease is up to 50%, with certain patients exhibiting no alleviation of symptoms. This review aims to outline the aetiology of endometriosis, detailing novel diagnostic approaches and potential therapeutic approaches, namely advanced therapeutic medical products (ATMPs), including stem cell therapy and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) gene editing. This timely review also provides novel insights into the important recent modalities which may be applied for the diagnosis and therapeutic response of endometriosis, including biomarkers, microfluidic platforms, and organoid systems. Undoubtedly, reliable, reproducible, sensitive, and specific models of endometriosis in humans are urgently needed to investigate and detail the aetiology of this debilitating disease.",

Key risk factors, including obesity, prolonged estrogen exposure, and metabolic disorders, underscore the urgent need for non-invasive, early diagnostic tools. This review focuses on the role of DNA methylation as a potential biomarker for early EC detection. Aberrant DNA methylation in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes can lead to gene silencing and cancer progression. We examine recent studies utilizing minimally invasive samples, such as urine, cervicovaginal, and cervical scrapes, to detect early-stage EC through DNA methylation patterns. Markers such as RASSF1A, HIST1H4F, GHSR, SST, and ZIC1 have demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with AUC values up to 0.95, effectively distinguishing EC from non-cancerous conditions. This review highlights the potential of DNA methylation-based testing as a non-invasive alternative to traditional diagnostic methods, offering earlier detection, better risk stratification, and more personalized treatment plans. These innovations hold the promise of transforming clinical practice by enabling more timely and effective management of endometrial cancer.",

      "abstract": "The genus Streptococcus is a heterogenous group of commensal and pathogenic bacteria that are normal inhabitants of the human body, including the female genital tract (FGT). In the FGT microbiome, streptococci represent two major groups: the pathogenic group B Streptococci (GBS) and the commensal viridans group streptococci (VGS). Though members of the VGS are frequently detected from the FGT, their role in the FGT microbiome remains underexplored. Here, we report the characterization of Streptococcus sp. K0074, isolated from the vaginal swab of an endometrial cancer patient admitted to the hospital, with no evidence of bacterial vaginosis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strain is a member of the commensal VGS and possibly represents a novel species in the mitis subgroup. The strain demonstrated the production of low molecular weight bacteriocin-like substance with narrow-spectrum antagonistic activity, affecting the growth, biofilm formation, and colonization of aerobic vaginitis (AV)-causing bacterium methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The putative bacteriocin exhibited cell membrane-permeabilizing activity and exerted negative regulatory effect on the accessory gene regulator and SaeRS two-component systems of MRSA. Collectively, our results suggest that the isolate may modulate the FGT microbiome by inhibiting or displacing specific pathogen. Furthermore, the results presented here highlight new perspectives regarding the existence of VGS in the FGT microbiome and in particular pinpoint the potential clinical significance of the isolated VGS strain Streptococcus sp. K0074 for the treatment of AV caused by MRSA.",

      "abstract": "The field of gynaecologic oncology has evolved rapidly in recent years, largely driven by advances in both radiotherapy and systemic therapies. These innovations have reshaped the management of key gynaecologic cancers, including cervical, endometrial, vaginal, and vulvar cancers, leading to more personalized and effective treatment approaches. This review explores pivotal clinical trials conducted between 2023 and 2024 that have potentially modified current practices. Through an extensive analysis of randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses, we examine the evolving role of radiotherapy, the integration and sequencing of immunotherapy, and the refinement of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments based on molecular classifications. The combination of immunotherapy with chemoradiotherapy has shown promising outcomes, particularly in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. For endometrial cancer, molecular profiling has enabled a more precise classification of tumour subtypes, leading to better-targeted adjuvant therapies that reduce unnecessary interventions and increase treatment efficacy. In parallel, radiotherapy has advanced with the increasing use of modern techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy and more recently the developments of adaptive treatments in order to minimize exposure to healthy tissue, thereby reducing toxicity and enhancing patient quality of life. Integration of image-guided brachytherapy and expansion of capabilities with newer generation of brachytherapy applicators have also increased possibilities to achieve efficient local treatments, including in very advanced cases. However, despite progress in common gynaecologic cancers, the management of rare cancers such as vulvar and vaginal cancers continues to face challenges due to limited clinical research and treatment data. This review highlights the transformative potential of these innovations and emphasizes the need for continued research and personalized treatment strategies to optimize patient outcomes in gynaecologic oncology.",

      "title": "Retinoblastoma Protein Loss in p53 Abnormal Endometrial Carcinoma: Histologic and Clinicopathological Correlates.",
      "abstract": "Of the 4 molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer (EC), p53-abnormal (p53abn) EC is associated with abundant copy number alterations and the worst clinical outcome. Patients with p53abn EC have the highest risk of disease recurrence and death, independent of tumor grade and histologic subtype. Currently, all invasive p53abn ECs are considered high risk, and no prognostic biomarkers have yet been found that can aid in clinical management. Here, we aimed to test whether loss of retinoblastoma (RB) protein expression using immunohistochemistry has the potential for prognostic refinement of p53abn EC. A large cohort of 227 p53abn ECs collected from the PORTEC-1/2/3 clinical trials and the Medisch Spectrum Twente cohort study was investigated, and RB loss was identified in 7.0% (n\u00a0= 16/227). RB-lost p53abn ECs were predominantly high-grade endometrioid ECs (n\u00a0= 6, 37.5%) and carcinosarcomas with endometrioid-type epithelial component (n\u00a0= 5, 31.3%). Histologically, RB-lost p53abn ECs were typified by high-grade nuclear atypia (n\u00a0= 16, 100%), predominantly solid growth pattern (n\u00a0= 15/16, 93.8%), and polypoid growth (n\u00a0= 9/16, 56.3%). Copy number loss involving the RB1 locus was identified in the majority of RB-lost p53abn EC (n\u00a0= 13/14, 92.9%), explaining the loss of RB expression. Comparative analysis also showed that RB-lost p53abn ECs were diagnosed at earlier stages than RB-retained p53abn EC (P\u00a0= .014). Interestingly, RB-lost p53abn EC showed prolonged time to overall recurrence (P\u00a0= .038), even within stage I alone (P\u00a0= .040). These findings highlight distinct morphomolecular features in RB-lost p53abn ECs and confirm the utility of RB immunohistochemistry as a surrogate for underlying molecular RB1 alterations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the potential use of RB in prognostic refinement of p53abn EC, although validation is warranted.",

      "abstract": "The ALK5 (TGFBR1) receptor serine/threonine kinase transduces TGF-\u03b2 (Transforming Growth Factor beta) signaling to activate SMAD2/3-dependent and -independent pathways. Here, we aimed to determine the functional consequences of ALK5 mutations in human endometrial cancer (EC). Somatic mutation data were retrieved from publicly available databases. Using seven in silico algorithms, 78.5% (11 of 14) of ALK5 kinase domain mutations in EC, including A230V-ALK5, were predicted to impact protein function. For in vitro studies, we focused on A230V-ALK5 because it was the only mutated residue located within the ATP-binding pocket, which is an important region for both ATP-binding and binding of ATP-competitive inhibitors. Constructs expressing wildtype-, constitutively-active-, kinase-dead-, or mutant A230V-ALK5, were transfected into NIH/3T3 cells. Following TGF-\u03b21 stimulation, transient exogenous expression of A230V-ALK5 resulted in attenuated SMAD2/3 signal transduction and reduced AKT activation. We further showed that the A230V-ALK5 mutant had reduced stability resulting from increased ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. Our structural modeling predicted that SB-431542, a small molecule ATP-competitive inhibitor of ALK5, binds to the A230V-ALK5 mutant with reduced affinity compared to wildtype-ALK5. We therefore examined the inhibitory effect of SB-431542 and galunisertib on wildtype- and mutant-ALK5 activity using a Smad-binding element (SBE) luciferase reporter assay combined with TGF-\u03b21 stimulation, in NIH/3T3 cells and HEC-265 EC cells. SBE luciferase activity in A230V-ALK5 transfected cells was inhibited less by SB-431542 and galunisertib than in wildtype-ALK5 transfected cells indicating that A230V-ALK5 is less sensitive to inhibition by these agents than wildtype-ALK5, potentially due to changes in SB-431542/A230V-ALK5 binding affinity. Our findings are novel and show that A230V-ALK5 is a partial loss-of-function mutant that attenuates TGF-\u03b21 signal transduction and has reduced sensitivity to ALK5 small molecule inhibitors.",

The amino acid sequence of FOXO3 contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and a nuclear export sequence (NES) allowing for nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling that plays an important role in regulating FOXO3 activity. Nuclear accumulation of FOXO3 proteins can be the result of translocation to the nucleus triggered by upstream regulatory input or trapping of FOXO3 within the nucleus through the inhibition of its nuclear export via the receptor CRM1. In order to distinguish these two modes of FOXO3 activation, we have generated a multiplexed assay. The development of this platform includes a reporter cell line that monitors CRM1 activity by using RFP-labeled HIV-1 Rev. protein with a strong heterologous NES. Simultaneously, the intracellular localization of FOXO3 can be monitored by a second cell line stably expressing GFP-FOXO3. Here we describe a detailed protocol on how to co-culture these reporter cell lines and use them to interrogate compound-induced FOXO3 activation in order to understand the mode of action.",

However, in previously irradiated patients, surgical resection can be considered the treatment of choice.

Traditional strategies for the treatment of VVFs include endoscopic treatment (when feasible) or a laparoscopic, robotic, or open abdominal approach in some experiences through a transvesical route. The last approach can be associated with long inpatient hospital stays, postoperative complications, and failure, especially in obese patients.

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC), a growing malignancy among women, underscores an urgent need for early detection and intervention, critical for enhancing patient outcomes and survival rates. Traditional diagnostic approaches, including ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hysteroscopy, and histopathology, have been essential in establishing robust diagnostic and prognostic frameworks for EC. These methods offer detailed insights into tumor morphology, vital for clinical decision-making. However, their analysis relies heavily on the expertise of radiologists and pathologists, a process that is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also prone to human error. The emergence of deep learning (DL) in computer vision has significantly transformed medical image analysis, presenting substantial potential for EC diagnosis. DL models, capable of autonomously learning and extracting complex features from imaging and histopathological data, have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in discriminating EC and stratifying patient prognoses. This review comprehensively examines and synthesizes the current literature on DL-based imaging techniques for EC diagnosis and management. It also aims to identify challenges faced by DL in this context and to explore avenues for its future development. Through these detailed analyses, our objective is to inform future research directions and promote the integration of DL into EC diagnostic and treatment strategies, thereby enhancing the precision and efficiency of clinical practice.",

Herein, a systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line treatments for advanced/recurrent EC. Searches were conducted using multiple databases through October 26, 2023. In total, 108 records of 57 unique trials (48 of first-line therapies) met the inclusion criteria. Baseline characteristics varied by study, and sample sizes ranged from 28 to 1328. Median progression-free survival was reported in 28 trials (range, 1.9-18.8 months), median overall survival in 26 trials with mature data (range, 6.9-41 months), and safety in 21 trials evaluating first-line systemic therapy \u00b1 maintenance. The potentially high risk of adverse events may outweigh the suboptimal efficacy benefits reported for conventional chemotherapy or hormonal therapies. The safety and efficacy of immunotherapies identified within are expected to contribute to a paradigm shift in the management of primary advanced/recurrent EC.",

      "abstract": "This article delves into the intricate interplay between tumors, particularly gynecologic malignancies, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The relationship between tumors, specifically gynecologic malignancies, and NETs is a multifaceted and pivotal area of study. Neutrophils, pivotal components of the immune system, are tasked with combating foreign invaders. NETs, intricate structures released by neutrophils, play a vital role in combating systemic infections but also play a role in non-infectious conditions such as inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Cancer cells have the ability to attract neutrophils, creating tumor-associated neutrophils, which then stimulate the release of NETs into the tumor microenvironment. The impact of NETs within the tumor microenvironment is profound and intricate. They play a significant role in influencing cancer development and metastasis, as well as modulating tumor immune responses. Through the release of proteases and pro-inflammatory cytokines, NETs directly alter the behavior of tumor cells, increasing invasiveness and metastatic potential. Additionally, NETs can trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transition in tumor cells, a process associated with increased invasion and metastasis. The interaction between tumors and NETs is particularly critical in gynecologic malignancies such as ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancer. Understanding the mechanisms through which NETs operate in these tumors can offer valuable insights for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Researchers are actively working towards harnessing this interaction to impede tumor progression and metastasis, opening up new avenues for future treatment modalities. As our understanding of the interplay between tumors and NETs deepens, it is anticipated that novel treatment strategies will emerge, potentially leading to improved outcomes for patients with gynecologic malignancies. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the latest research findings on the interaction between NETs and cancer, particularly in gynecologic tumors, serving as a valuable resource for future exploration in this field.",
